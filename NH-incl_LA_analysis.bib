  abstract={Statement of problem: Artificial intelligence applications are increasing in prosthodontics. Still, the current development and performance of artificial intelligence in prosthodontic applications has not yet been systematically documented and analyzed. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the performance of the artificial intelligence models in prosthodontics for tooth shade selection, automation of restoration design, mapping the tooth preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures. Material and methods: An electronic systematic review was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also conducted. Studies with artificial intelligence models were selected based on 6 criteria: tooth shade selection, automated fabrication of dental restorations, mapping the finishing line of tooth preparations, optimizing the manufacturing casting process, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality assessment of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (nonrandomized experimental studies). A third investigator was consulted to resolve lack of consensus. Results: A total of 36 articles were reviewed and classified into 6 groups based on the application of the artificial intelligence model. One article reported on the development of an artificial intelligence model for tooth shade selection, reporting better shade matching than with conventional visual selection; 14 articles reported on the feasibility of automated design of dental restorations using different artificial intelligence models; 1 artificial intelligence model was able to mark the margin line without manual interaction with an average accuracy ranging from 90.6% to 97.4%; 2 investigations developed artificial intelligence algorithms for optimizing the manufacturing casting process, reporting an improvement of the design process, minimizing the porosity on the cast metal, and reducing the overall manufacturing time; 1 study proposed an artificial intelligence model that was able to predict facial changes in patients using removable prostheses; and 17 investigations that developed clinical decision support, expert systems for designing removable partial dentures for clinicians and educational purposes, computer-aided learning with video interactive programs for student learning, and automated removable partial denture design. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence models have shown the potential for providing a reliable diagnostic tool for tooth shade selection, automated restoration design, mapping the preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting, predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures, but they are still in development. Additional studies are needed to further develop and assess their clinical performance. © 2021 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry},

  abstract={Background: Accident and Emergency Department (AED) is the frontline of providing emergency care in a hospital and research focusing on improving decision-makings and service level around AED has been driving a rising number of attentions in recent years. A retrospective review among the published papers shows that related research can be classified according to six planning modules: demand forecasting, days-off scheduling, shift scheduling, line-of-work construction, task assignment and staff assignment. As patient arrivals demand forecasts enable smooth AED operational planning and help decision-making, this article conducted a systematic review on the statistical modelling approaches aimed at predicting the volume of AED patients’ arrival. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of AED patient arrivals prediction studies from 2004 to 2021. The Medline, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched. A two-step screening process was carried out based on the title and abstract or full text, and 35 of 1,677 articles were selected. Our methods and results follow the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We categorise AED methods for modelling patient arrivals into four main classes: regression, time series, artificial intelligence and time series regression. Choice of prediction model, selection of factors and model performance are compared. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the models and suggest future research directions. Results: A total of 1,677 papers that fulfilled the initial searching criteria was obtained from the three databases. Based on the first exclusion criteria, 1,603 articles were eliminated. The remaining 74 full text articles were evaluated based on the second exclusion criteria. Finally, 35 articles were selected for full review. We find that the use of artificial intelligence-based model has risen in recent years, from the view of predictive model selection. The calendar-based factors are most commonly used compared with other types of dependent variables, from the view of dependent variable selection. Conclusions: All AEDs are inherently different and different covariables may have different effects on patient arrivals. Certain factors may play a key role in one AED but not others. Based on results of meta-analysis, when modelling patient arrivals, it is essential to understand the actual AED situation and carefully select relevant dominating factors and the most suitable modelling method. Local calibration is also important to ensure good estimates. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Objective: This systematic literature review aims to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently used in emergency departments (ED) and how it alters the work design of ED clinicians. AI is still new and unknown to many healthcare professionals in emergency care, leading to unfamiliarity with its capabilities. Method: Various criteria were used to establish the suitability of the articles to answer the research question. This study was based on 34 selected peer-reviewed papers on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Emergency Department (ED), published in the last five years. Drawing on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all articles were scanned, read full-text, and analyzed afterward. Results: The majority of the AI applications consisted of AI-based tools to aid with clinical decisions and to relieve overcrowded EDs of their burden. AI support was mostly offered during triage, the moment that sets the patient trajectory. There is ample evidence that AI-based applications could improve the clinical decision-making process. Conclusion: The use of AI in EDs is still in its nascent stages. Many studies focus on the question of whether AI has clinical utility, such as decision support, improving resource allocation, reducing diagnostic errors, and promoting proactivity. Some studies suggest that AI-based tools essentially have the ability to outperform human skills. However, it is evident from the literature that current technology does not have the aims or power to do so. Nevertheless, AI-based tools can impact clinician work design in the ED by providing support with clinical decisions, which could ultimately help alleviate a portion of the increasing clinical burden. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Machine learning is frequently being leveraged to tackle problems in the health sector including utilization for clinical decision-support. Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Aims and objectives: To summarize the use of machine learning (ML) for hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) prediction and to systematically assess the performance and construction process of ML models to provide references for establishing high-quality ML predictive models. Background: As an adverse event, HAPI seriously affects patient prognosis and quality of life, and causes unnecessary medical investment. At present, the performance of various scales used to predict HAPIs is still unsatisfactory. As a new statistical tool, ML has been applied to predict HAPIs. However, its performance has varied in different studies; moreover, some deficiencies in the model construction process were observed in each study. Design: Systematic review. Methods: Relevant articles published between 2010–2021 were identified in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and CINHAL databases. Study selection was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool. Results: Twenty-three studies out of 1793 articles were considered in this systematic review. The sample size of each study ranged from 149–75353; the prevalence of pressure injuries ranged from 0.5%–49.8%. ML showed good performance for HAPI prediction. However, some deficiencies were observed in terms of data management, data pre-processing and model validation. Conclusions: ML, as a powerful decision-making assistance tool, is helpful for the prediction of HAPIs. However, existing studies have been insufficient in terms of data management, data pre-processing and model validation. Future studies should address these issues to establish ML models for HAPI prediction that can be widely used in clinical practice. Relevance to Clinical Practice: This review highlights that ML is helpful in predicting HAPI; however, in the process of data management, data pre-processing and model validation, some deficiencies still need to be addressed. The ultimate goal of integrating ML into HAPI prediction is to develop a practical clinical decision-making tool. A complete and rigorous model construction process should be followed in future studies to develop high-quality ML models that can be applied in clinical practice. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to augment clinicians' diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. It is well suited to identify patterns and correlations within data sets and may be applied to identify elements of importance in complex and data-laden areas such as patient selection, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome prediction. The development of modern neurosurgery has been dependent on major technological advances. In line with this, a growing interest is seen in the use of AI to assist in neurosurgical research and enhance neurosurgical practices. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles alluding to the use of AI in neurosurgery, from inception until July of 2022, was undertaken using the Web of Science database. Statistical analyses were performed on R. Results: The citation count ranged from 29 to 159 (mean: 51.9, standard deviation: 24.8), and the top-cited article was a 2018 systematic review published in World Neurosurgery. Most articles were published after 2015 (85%). The United States was the largest contributing country on the list with 22 articles. Four first and last authors, each, had 2 or more publications. Female first and last authorship was attributed to 18% and 0% of the articles, respectively. Conclusions: This review highlights the most-impactful articles pertaining to AI in the field of neurosurgery. Although female authors were significantly underrepresented on the list, their work was at least as impactful as their male peers. Finally, the striking dominance of articles originating from the developed world raises concerns as to the future of AI in attending to the global health crisis. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Background: The expansion of the availability of advanced imaging methods needs more time, expertise, and resources which is in contrast to the primary goal of the imaging techniques. To overcome most of these difficulties, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used. A number of studies used AI models for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and reported diverse results. Therefore, we aim to perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study on the role of AI in the diagnosis of MS. Methods: We performed a systematic search using four databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE. Studies that applied deep learning or AI to the diagnosis of MS based on any modalities were considered eligible in our study. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under curve (AUC) were pooled with a random-effects model and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: After the screening, 41 articles with 5989 individuals met the inclusion criteria and were included in our qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Our analysis showed that the overall accuracy among studies was 94% (95%CI: 93%, 96%). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95%CI: 90%, 95%) and 93% (95%CI: 90%, 96%), respectively. Furthermore, our analysis showed 92% precision in MS diagnosis for AI studies (95%CI: 88%, 97%). Also, the overall pooled AUC was 93% (95%CI: 89%, 96%). Conclusion: Overall, AI models can further improve our diagnostic practice in MS patients. Our results indicate that the use of AI can aid the clinicians in accurate diagnosis of MS and improve current diagnostic approaches as most of the parameters including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and AUC were considerably high, especially when using MRI data. © 2022, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.},

  abstract={Background: Predicting morphological changes to anatomical structures from 3D shapes such as blood vessels or appearance of the face is a growing interest to clinicians. Machine learning (ML) has had great success driving predictions in 2D, however, methods suitable for 3D shapes are unclear and the use cases unknown. Objective and methods: This systematic review aims to identify the clinical implementation of 3D shape prediction and ML workflows. Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched until 28th March 2022. Results: 13,754 articles were identified, with 12 studies meeting final inclusion criteria. These studies involved prediction of the face, head, aorta, forearm, and breast, with most aiming to visualize shape changes after surgical interventions. ML algorithms identified were regressions (67%), artificial neural networks (25%), and principal component analysis (8%). Meta-analysis was not feasible due to the heterogeneity of the outcomes. Conclusion: 3D shape prediction is a nascent but growing area of research in medicine. This review revealed the feasibility of predicting 3D shapes using ML clinically, which could play an important role for clinician-patient visualization and communication. However, all studies were early phase and there were inconsistent language and reporting. Future work could develop guidelines for publication and promote open sharing of source code. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: The rhetoric surrounding clinical artificial intelligence (AI) often exaggerates its effect on real-world care. Limited understanding of the factors that influence its implementation can perpetuate this. Objective: In this qualitative systematic review, we aimed to identify key stakeholders, consolidate their perspectives on clinical AI implementation, and characterize the evidence gaps that future qualitative research should target. Methods: Ovid-MEDLINE, EBSCO-CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Science Citation Index-Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for primary qualitative studies on individuals’ perspectives on any application of clinical AI worldwide (January 2014-April 2021). The definition of clinical AI includes both rule-based and machine learning–enabled or non–rule-based decision support tools. The language of the reports was not an exclusion criterion. Two independent reviewers performed title, abstract, and full-text screening with a third arbiter of disagreement. Two reviewers assigned the Joanna Briggs Institute 10-point checklist for qualitative research scores for each study. A single reviewer extracted free-text data relevant to clinical AI implementation, noting the stakeholders contributing to each excerpt. The best-fit framework synthesis used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. To validate the data and improve accessibility, coauthors representing each emergent stakeholder group codeveloped summaries of the factors most relevant to their respective groups. Results: The initial search yielded 4437 deduplicated articles, with 111 (2.5%) eligible for inclusion (median Joanna Briggs Institute 10-point checklist for qualitative research score, 8/10). Five distinct stakeholder groups emerged from the data: health care professionals (HCPs), patients, carers and other members of the public, developers, health care managers and leaders, and regulators or policy makers, contributing 1204 (70%), 196 (11.4%), 133 (7.7%), 129 (7.5%), and 59 (3.4%) of 1721 eligible excerpts, respectively. All stakeholder groups independently identified a breadth of implementation factors, with each producing data that were mapped between 17 and 24 of the 27 adapted Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability subdomains. Most of the factors that stakeholders found influential in the implementation of rule-based clinical AI also applied to non–rule-based clinical AI, with the exception of intellectual property, regulation, and sociocultural attitudes. Conclusions: Clinical AI implementation is influenced by many interdependent factors, which are in turn influenced by at least 5 distinct stakeholder groups. This implies that effective research and practice of clinical AI implementation should consider multiple stakeholder perspectives. The current underrepresentation of perspectives from stakeholders other than HCPs in the literature may limit the anticipation and management of the factors that influence successful clinical AI implementation. Future research should not only widen the representation of tools and contexts in qualitative research but also specifically investigate the perspectives of all stakeholder HCPs and emerging aspects of non–rule-based clinical AI implementation. ©Henry David Jeffry Hogg, Mohaimen Al-Zubaidy, Technology Enhanced Macular Services Study Reference Group, James Talks, Alastair K Denniston, Christopher J Kelly, Johann Malawana, Chrysanthi Papoutsi, Marion Dawn Teare, Pearse A Keane, Fiona R Beyer, Gregory Maniatopoulos.},

  abstract={Over the last decade, there has been great research interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as medicine, finance, and law. Recently, there has been a research focus on the application of AI in education, where it has great potential. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration. Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The results reveal that the main AI applications in education are: predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology, automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI technologies in higher education in the Latin American context. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: The first-line and most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is nasal continuous positive airway pressure, which serves as a pneumatic splint to stabilize the upper airway and is effective when used with appropriate adherence. Continuous positive airway pressure compliance rates remain significantly low despite machine improvements and compliance intervention. Other treatment options include oral appliances, myofunctional therapy, and surgery. The aim of this project is to elucidate the role of artificial intelligence within improving the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Methods: Related publications between 1999 and 2022 were reviewed from PubMed and Embase databases utilizing search terms “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “obstructive sleep apnea,” and “treatment.” Both authors independently screened the results by title/abstract then by full text review. 126 non-duplicate articles were screened, 38 articles were included after title and abstract screen and 30 articles were included after full text review. The inclusion criteria are outline in the PICO framework and involved studies focused on artificial intelligence application in guiding and evaluating obstructive sleep apnea treatment. Non-English articles were excluded. Results: The role of artificial intelligence in the treatment of OSA was categorized into the following sections: Predicting treatment outcomes of various treatment options, Improving/Evaluating treatment, and Personalizing treatment with improving understanding of underlying mechanisms of OSA. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has the capacity to improve the treatment of OSA through predicting outcomes of treatment options, evaluating the treatment the patient is currently utilizing and increasing understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to OSA disease process and physiology. Implementing AI in guiding treatment decisions allows patients to connect with treatment methods that would be most effective on an individual basis. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly adopted to support various activities in education, including being applied in important contexts such as college admission and scholarship allocation. In addition to being accurate, the application of these techniques has to be fair, i.e., displaying no discrimination towards any group of stakeholders in education (mainly students and instructors) based on their protective attributes (e.g., gender and age). The past few years have witnessed an explosion of attention given to the predictive bias of ML techniques in education. Though certain endeavors have been made to detect and alleviate predictive bias in learning analytics, it is still hard for newcomers to penetrate. To address this, we systematically reviewed existing studies on predictive bias in education, and a total of 49 peer-reviewed empirical papers published after 2010 were included in this study. In particular, these papers were reviewed and summarized from the following three perspectives: (i) protective attributes, (ii) fairness measures and their applications in various educational tasks, and (iii) strategies for enhancing predictive fairness. These findings were summarized into recommendations to guide future endeavors in this strand of research, e.g., collecting and sharing more quality data containing protective attributes, developing fairness-enhancing approaches which do not require the explicit use of protective attributes, validating the effectiveness of fairness-enhancing on students and instructors in real-world settings.  © 2023 ACM.},

  abstract={Background: Here, we conducted a scoping review to (i) establish which machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to hematological malignancy imaging; (ii) establish how ML is being applied to hematological cancer radiology; and (iii) identify addressable research gaps. Methods: The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) pediatric and adult patients with suspected or confirmed hematological malignancy undergoing imaging (population); (ii) any study using ML techniques to derive models using radiological images to apply to the clinical management of these patients (concept); and (iii) original research articles conducted in any setting globally (context). Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 criteria were used to assess diagnostic and segmentation studies, while the Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of observational studies. Results: Of 53 eligible studies, 33 applied diverse ML techniques to diagnose hematological malignancies or to differentiate them from other diseases, especially discriminating gliomas from primary central nervous system lymphomas (n=18); 11 applied ML to segmentation tasks, while 9 applied ML to prognostication or predicting therapeutic responses, especially for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. All studies reported discrimination statistics, but no study calculated calibration statistics. Every diagnostic/segmentation study had a high risk of bias due to their case–control design; many studies failed to provide adequate details of the reference standard; and only a few studies used independent validation. Conclusion: To deliver validated ML-based models to radiologists managing hematological malignancies, future studies should (i) adhere to standardized, high-quality reporting guidelines such as the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging; (ii) validate models in independent cohorts; (ii) standardize volume segmentation methods for segmentation tasks; (iv) establish comprehensive prospective studies that include different tumor grades, comparisons with radiologists, optimal imaging modalities, sequences, and planes; (v) include side-by-side comparisons of different methods; and (vi) include low- and middle-income countries in multicentric studies to enhance generalizability and reduce inequity.

  abstract={Objective: This study aimed to analyze the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for orthodontic tooth extraction decision-making. Materials and methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, LIVIVO, Computers & Applied Science, ACM Digital Library, Compendex, and gray literature (OpenGrey, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) were electronically searched. Three independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted and analyzed the data. Risk of bias, methodological quality, and certainty of evidence were assessed by QUADAS-2, checklist for AI research, and GRADE, respectively. Results: The search identified 1810 studies. After 2 phases of selection, six studies were included, showing an unclear risk of bias of patient selection. Two studies showed a high risk of bias in the index test, while two others presented an unclear risk of bias in the diagnostic test. Data were pooled in a random model and yielded an accuracy value of 0.87 (95% CI = 0.75–0.96) for all studies, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.70–1.00) for multilayer perceptron, and 0.88 (95% CI = 0.73–0.98) for back propagation models. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of the multilayer perceptron model yielded 0.84 (95% CI = 0.58–1.00), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.74–0.98), and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.72–1.00) scores, respectively. Sagittal discrepancy, upper crowding, and protrusion showed the highest ranks weighted in the models. Conclusions: Orthodontic tooth extraction decision-making using AI presented promising accuracy but should be considered with caution due to the very low certainty of evidence. Clinical relevance: AI models for tooth extraction decision in orthodontics cannot yet be considered a substitute for a final human decision. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background and Objective: The automatic assessment of pain is vital in designing optimal pain management interventions focused on reducing suffering and preventing the functional decline of patients. In recent years, there has been a surge in the adoption of deep learning algorithms by researchers attempting to encode the multidimensional nature of pain into meaningful features. This systematic review aims to discuss the models, the methods, and the types of data employed in establishing the foundation of a deep learning-based automatic pain assessment system. Methods: The systematic review was conducted by identifying original studies searching digital libraries, namely Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to retrieve and select those of interest, published until December 2021. Results: A total of one hundred and ten publications were identified and categorized by the number of information channels used (unimodal versus multimodal approaches) and whether the temporal dimension was also used. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the importance of multimodal approaches for automatic pain estimation, especially in clinical settings, and also reveals that significant improvements are observed when the temporal exploitation of modalities is included. It provides suggestions regarding better-performing deep architectures and learning methods.

  abstract={Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively. Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Technological advancements in health sciences have led to enormous developments in artificial intelligence (AI) models designed for application in health sectors. This article aimed at reporting on the application and performances of AI models that have been designed for application in endodontics. Renowned online databases, primarily PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane and secondarily Google Scholar and the Saudi Digital Library, were accessed for articles relevant to the research question that were published from 1 January 2000 to 30 November 2022. In the last 5 years, there has been a significant increase in the number of articles reporting on AI models applied for endodontics. AI models have been developed for determining working length, vertical root fractures, root canal failures, root morphology, and thrust force and torque in canal preparation; detecting pulpal diseases; detecting and diagnosing periapical lesions; predicting postoperative pain, curative effect after treatment, and case difficulty; and segmenting pulp cavities. Most of the included studies (n = 21) were developed using convolutional neural networks. Among the included studies. datasets that were used were mostly cone-beam computed tomography images, followed by periapical radiographs and panoramic radiographs. Thirty-seven original research articles that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were critically assessed in accordance with QUADAS-2 guidelines, which revealed a low risk of bias in the patient selection domain in most of the studies (risk of bias: 90%; applicability: 70%). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. These models can be used as supplementary tools in clinical practice in order to expedite the clinical decision-making process and enhance the treatment modality and clinical operation. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to solve several issues affecting COVID-19 diagnosis. This systematic review research explores the impact of AI in early COVID-19 screening, detection, and diagnosis. A comprehensive survey of AI in the COVID-19 literature, mainly in the context of screening and diagnosis, was observed by applying the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data sources for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were retrieved from google scholar, web of science, Scopus, and PubMed, with target keywords relating to AI in COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. After a comprehensive review of these studies, the results found that AI contributed immensely to improving COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. Some proposed AI models were shown to have comparable (sometimes even better) clinical decision outcomes, compared to experienced radiologists in the screening/diagnosing of COVID-19. Additionally, AI has the capacity to reduce physician work burdens and fatigue and reduce the problems of several false positives, associated with the RT-PCR test (with lower sensitivity of 60–70%) and medical imaging analysis. Even though AI was found to be timesaving and cost-effective, with less clinical errors, it works optimally under the supervision of a physician or other specialists. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Objectives To identify ML tools in hospital settings and how they were implemented to inform decision-making for patient care through a scoping review. We investigated the following research questions: What ML interventions have been used to inform decision-making for patient care in hospital settings? What strategies have been used to implement these ML interventions? Design A scoping review was undertaken. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched from 2009 until June 2021. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data independently. Conflicts were resolved by another reviewer. Data were summarised descriptively using simple content analysis. Setting Hospital setting. Participant Any type of clinician caring for any type of patient. Intervention Machine learning tools used by clinicians to inform decision-making for patient care, such as AI-based computerised decision support systems or " € model-based'"decision support systems. Primary and secondary outcome measures Patient and study characteristics, as well as intervention characteristics including the type of machine learning tool, implementation strategies, target population. Equity issues were examined with PROGRESS-PLUS criteria. Results After screening 17 386 citations and 3474 full-text articles, 20 unique studies and 1 companion report were included. The included articles totalled 82 656 patients and 915 clinicians. Seven studies reported gender and four studies reported PROGRESS-PLUS criteria (race, health insurance, rural/urban). Common implementation strategies for the tools were clinician reminders that integrated ML predictions (44.4%), facilitated relay of clinical information (17.8%) and staff education (15.6%). Common barriers to successful implementation of ML tools were time (11.1%) and reliability (11.1%), and common facilitators were time/efficiency (13.6%) and perceived usefulness (13.6%). Conclusions We found limited evidence related to the implementation of ML tools to assist clinicians with patient healthcare decisions in hospital settings. Future research should examine other approaches to integrating ML into hospital clinician decisions related to patient care, and report on PROGRESS-PLUS items.

  abstract={Background: Medical researchers and clinicians have shown much interest in developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect/predict surgical site infections (SSIs). However, little is known about the overall performance of ML algorithms in predicting SSIs and how to improve the algorithm's robustness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the performance of ML algorithms in SSIs case detection and prediction and to describe the impact of using unstructured and textual data in the development of ML algorithms. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 25, 2021. Study characteristics and algorithm development information were extracted. Performance statistics (e.g., sensitivity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) were pooled using a random effect model. Stratified analysis was applied to different study characteristic levels. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) was followed. Results: Of 945 articles identified, 108 algorithms from 32 articles were included in this review. The overall pooled estimate of the SSI incidence rate was 3.67%, 95% CI: 3.58–3.76. Mixed-use of structured and textual data-based algorithms (pooled estimates of sensitivity 0.83, 95% CI: 0.78–0.87, specificity 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.95, AUC 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89–0.94) outperformed algorithms solely based on structured data (sensitivity 0.56, 95% CI:0.43–0.69, specificity 0.95, 95% CI:0.91–0.97, AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87–0.92). Conclusions: ML algorithms developed with structured and textual data provided optimal performance. External validation of ML algorithms is needed to translate current knowledge into clinical practice. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an incredible amount of fake news and conspiracy theories around the world. Calls for the integration of COVID-19 and fake news-related research have been advanced in various fields. This paper aims to unpack a structured overview of previous research topics and findings and identify gaps. Our goal in this systematic review is to (a) synthesize the selected earlier studies, (b) offer researchers a structural framework for future COVID-19 and fake news research, and (c) recommend relevant areas for future research. In this study, we focus on eighty conceptual and empirical studies on misinformation of COVID-19-related news on social media. We identify vital publications and methodological and theoretical approaches that exist in the COVID-19 literature. The articles were systematically analyzed, focusing on the research context and time frame, data collection/analysis procedures, and equivalence issues. While COVID-19 research has been advancing significantly over the past couple of months, numerous questions remain unexplained in the domain of the social media landscape. For example, our review suggests that researchers should begin to concentrate on a process framework blending Artificial Intelligence (AI) to curb the fake news problem. This can be achieved in all three phases, e.g., the study of individual decisions and experiences, the experiences of groups and organizations and the interactions between them, and finally, the interactions at the broadest level (micro, meso, and macro stages). © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Purpose for Review: This perspective piece has two goals: first, to describe issues related to artificial intelligence-based applications for cancer control as they may impact health inequities or disparities; and second, to report on a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of artificial intelligence-based tools for cancer control to ascertain the extent to which discussions of justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, or health disparities manifest in syntheses of the field’s best evidence. Recent Findings: We found that, while a significant proportion of existing syntheses of research on AI-based tools in cancer control use formal bias assessment tools, the fairness or equitability of models is not yet systematically analyzable across studies. Issues related to real-world use of AI-based tools for cancer control, such as workflow considerations, measures of usability and acceptance, or tool architecture, are more visible in the literature, but still addressed only in a minority of reviews. Summary: Artificial intelligence is poised to bring significant benefits to a wide range of applications in cancer control, but more thorough and standardized evaluations and reporting of model fairness are required to build the evidence base for AI-based tool design for cancer and to ensure that these emerging technologies promote equitable healthcare. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Rational: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are being considered more frequently when providing orthopaedic care due to their impact on treatment outcomes. Simultaneously, prognostic machine learning (ML) models that facilitate clinical decision making have become popular tools in the field of orthopaedic surgery. When ML-driven tools are developed, it is important that the perpetuation of potential disparities is minimized. One approach is to consider SDOH during model development. To date, it remains unclear whether and how existing prognostic ML models for orthopaedic outcomes consider SDOH variables. Objective: To investigate whether prognostic ML models for orthopaedic surgery outcomes account for SDOH, and to what extent SDOH variables are included in the final models. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane for studies published up to 17 November 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted SDOH features using the PROGRESS+ framework (place of residence, race/ethnicity, Occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, social capital, socioeconomic status, ‘Plus+’ age, disability, and sexual orientation). Results: The search yielded 7138 studies, of which 59 met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, 96% (57/59) considered at least one PROGRESS+ factor during development. The most common factors were age (95%; 56/59) and gender/sex (96%; 57/59). Differential effect analyses, such as subgroup analysis, covariate adjustment, and baseline comparison, were rarely reported (10%; 6/59). The majority of models included age (92%; 54/59) and gender/sex (69%; 41/59) as final input variables. However, factors such as insurance status (7%; 4/59), marital status (7%; 4/59) and income (3%; 2/59) were seldom included. Conclusion: The current level of reporting and consideration of SDOH during the development of prognostic ML models for orthopaedic outcomes is limited. Healthcare providers should be critical of the models they consider using and knowledgeable regarding the quality of model development, such as adherence to recognized methodological standards. Future efforts should aim to avoid bias and disparities when developing ML-driven applications for orthopaedics. © 2022 The Authors.

This in turn pose challenges to human resource managers, tasked with governing the AI adoption processes. However, these challenges afford opportunities to critically examine the various facets of AI systems as they interface with human resources. To that end, we systematically review the literature at the intersection of AI and human resource management (HRM). Using the configurational approach, we identify the evolution of different theme based causal configurations in conceptual and empirical research and the outcomes of AI-HRM interaction. We observe incremental mutations in thematic causal configurations as the literature evolves and also provide thematic configuration based explanations to beneficial and reactionary outcomes in the AI-HRM interaction process. © 2022},

  abstract={Introduction: Kidney transplantation is one of the most important surgical operations requiring much attention to patients' condition after the transplant. Data mining can be used as a useful tool to inspect the condition of these patients and provide reliable advice to physicians. The aim of this study was to identify the data mining applications in kidney transplantation. Methods: This systematic review was conducted in 2022. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase scientific databases, based on the combination of related MeSH terms. The articles selection process was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Articles selection was done by using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data gathering was done using a data extraction form. Results: Of the 873 articles finally 31 articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that 85% of the algorithms are applied to the prediction of kidney transplantation success or failure. Decision Tree (nine studies) and Bayesian (eight studies) techniques were the most frequent techniques among the prevalent machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: The use of data mining methods can play a functional role in predicting the results of kidney transplantation. It is recommended to use the data mining method to help predict the best method of diagnosis and treatment in kidney transplants. © 2023},

  abstract={Background. Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly, and its application extends to clinical decision support system (CDSS) for improving healthcare quality. However, the interpretability of AI-driven CDSS poses significant challenges to widespread application. Objective. This study is a review of the knowledge-based and data-based CDSS literature regarding interpretability in health care. It highlights the relevance of interpretability for CDSS and the area for improvement from technological and medical perspectives. Methods. A systematic search was conducted on the interpretability-related literature published from 2011 to 2020 and indexed in the five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Scopus. Journal articles that focus on the interpretability of CDSS were included for analysis. Experienced researchers also participated in manually reviewing the selected articles for inclusion/exclusion and categorization. Results. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles from 16 journals were finally selected for this review. Interpretability, which means a transparent structure of the model, a clear relationship between input and output, and explainability of artificial intelligence algorithms, is essential for CDSS application in the healthcare setting. Methods for improving the interpretability of CDSS include ante-hoc methods such as fuzzy logic, decision rules, logistic regression, decision trees for knowledge-based AI, and white box models, post hoc methods such as feature importance, sensitivity analysis, visualization, and activation maximization for black box models. A number of factors, such as data type, biomarkers, human-AI interaction, needs of clinicians, and patients, can affect the interpretability of CDSS. Conclusions. The review explores the meaning of the interpretability of CDSS and summarizes the current methods for improving interpretability from technological and medical perspectives. The results contribute to the understanding of the interpretability of CDSS based on AI in health care. Future studies should focus on establishing formalism for defining interpretability, identifying the properties of interpretability, and developing an appropriate and objective metric for interpretability; in addition, the user's demand for interpretability and how to express and provide explanations are also the directions for future research.  © 2023 Qian Xu et al.},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning has been attracting increasing attention for use in healthcare applications, including neonatal medicine. One application for this tool is in understanding and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. In this study, we have carried out a systematic review to identify findings and challenges to date. Methods: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Four databases were searched in February 2022, with articles then screened in a non-blinded manner by two authors. Results: The literature search returned 278 studies, with 11 meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Convolutional neural networks were the most common machine learning approach, with most studies seeking to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes from images and connectomes describing brain structure and function. Studies to date also sought to identify features predictive of outcomes; however, results varied greatly. Conclusions: Initial studies in this field have achieved promising results; however, many machine learning techniques remain to be explored, and the consensus is yet to be reached on which clinical and brain features are most predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Impact: This systematic review looks at the question of whether machine learning can be used to predict and understand neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants.Our review finds that promising initial works have been conducted in this field, but many challenges and opportunities remain.Quality assessment of relevant articles is conducted using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.This work identifies challenges that remain and suggests several key directions for future research.To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review to explore this topic. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background and objective: Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in medical decision support systems. AI also plays an essential role in snakebite identification (SI). To date, no review has been conducted on AI-based SI. This work aims to identify, compare, and summarize the state-of-the-art AI methods in SI. Another objective is to analyze these methods and propose solutions for future directions. Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Engineering Village, and IEEE Xplore to identify the SI studies. The datasets, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms of these studies were systematically reviewed. Then, their merits and defects were also analyzed and compared. Next, the quality of these studies was assessed by using the ChAIMAI checklist. Finally, solutions were proposed based on the limitations of current studies. Results: Twenty-six articles were included in the review. Traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms were applied for the classification of snake images (Acc = 72 %∼98 %), wound images (Acc = 80 %∼100 %), and other modalities of information (Acc = 71.67 %∼97.6 %). According to the research quality assessment, one of the studies was considered to be of high quality. Most studies were flawed in data preparation, data understanding, validation, and deployment dimensions. In addition, we propose an active perception-based system framework for collecting images and bite forces and constructing a multi-modal dataset named “Digital Snake” to address the lack of high-quality datasets for DL algorithms to improve recognition accuracy and robustness. A Snakebite Identification, Treatment, and Management Assistive Platform architecture is also proposed as a decision support system for patients and doctors. Conclusions: AI-based methods can quickly and accurately decide the snake species and classify venomous and non-venomous snakes. Current studies still have limitations in SI. Future studies based on AI methods should focus on constructing high-quality datasets and decision support systems for snakebite treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients’ map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI. © 2023 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning has been applied to improve diagnosis and prognostication of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. We investigate potential for clinical integration of machine learning in this patient population to navigate variability in injury and recovery. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines through PubMed database to identify studies that use machine learning algorithms for clinical application toward improvements in diagnosis, management, and predictive modeling. Results: Of the 132 records identified, a total of 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in final analysis. Of the 13 articles, 5 focused on diagnostic accuracy and 8 were related to prognostication or management of traumatic spinal cord injury. Across studies, 1983 patients with spinal cord injury were evaluated with most classifying as ASIA C or D. Retrospective designs were used in 10 of 13 studies and 3 were prospective. Studies focused on MRI evaluation and segmentation for diagnostic accuracy and prognostication, investigation of mean arterial pressure in acute care and intraoperative settings, prediction of ambulatory and functional ability, chronic complication prevention, and psychological quality of life assessments. Decision tree, random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), hierarchical cluster tree analysis (HCTA), artificial neural networks ( ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) machine learning subtypes were used. Conclusions: Machine learning represents a platform technology with clinical application in traumatic spinal cord injury diagnosis, prognostication, management, rehabilitation, and risk prevention of chronic complications and mental illness. SVM models showed improved accuracy when compared to other ML subtypes surveyed. Inherent variability across patients with SCI offers unique opportunity for ML and personalized medicine to drive desired outcomes and assess risks in this patient population. © 2022},

Using a systematically derived sample of research, we categorize and distill a multitude of factors into four themes: goals, foundations, design considerations, and application. We propose positive influences of six factors and a negative influence of one, namely costs, on the decision to increase the level of automation of a management decision.

  abstract={Brain informatics is a novel interdisciplinary area that focuses on scientifically studying the mechanisms of human brain information processing by integrating experimental cognitive neuroscience with advanced Web intelligence-centered information technologies. Web intelligence, which aims to understand the computational, cognitive, physical, and social foundations of the future Web, has attracted increasing attention to facilitate the study of brain informatics to promote human health. A large number of articles created in the recent few years are proof of the investment in Web intelligence-assisted human health. This study systematically reviews academic studies regarding article trends, top journals, subjects, countries/regions, and institutions, study design, artificial intelligence technologies, clinical tasks, and performance evaluation. Results indicate that literature is especially welcomed in subjects such as medical informatics and health care sciences and service. There are several promising topics, for example, random forests, support vector machines, and conventional neural networks for disease detection and diagnosis, semantic Web, ontology mining, and topic modeling for clinical or biomedical text mining, artificial neural networks and logistic regression for prediction, and convolutional neural networks and support vector machines for monitoring and classification. Additionally, future research should focus on algorithm innovations, additional information use, functionality improvement, model and system generalization, scalability, evaluation, and automation, data acquirement and quality improvement, and allowing interaction. The findings of this study help better understand what and how Web intelligence can be applied to promote healthcare procedures and clinical outcomes. This provides important insights into the effective use of Web intelligence to support informatics-enabled brain studies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objective: To evaluate the study quality and clinical value of radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched for articles on radiomics for evaluating chondrosarcoma as of January 31, 2022. The study quality was assessed according to Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guideline, and modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The level of evidence supporting clinical use of radiomics on chondrosarcoma differential diagnosis was determined based on meta-analyses. Results: Twelve articles were included. The median RQS was 10.5 (range, −3 to 15), with an adherence rate of 36%. The adherence rate was extremely low in domains of high-level evidence (0%), open science and data (17%), and imaging and segmentation (35%). The adherence rate of the TRIPOD checklist was 61%, and low for section of title and abstract (13%), introduction (42%), and results (56%). The reporting rate of pre-processing steps according to the IBSI guideline was 60%. The risk of bias and concern of application were mainly related to the index test. The meta-analysis on differential diagnosis of enchondromas vs. chondrosarcomas showed a diagnostic odds ratio of 43.90 (95% confidential interval, 25.33–76.10), which was rated as weak evidence. Conclusions: The current scientific and reporting quality of radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma was insufficient. Radiomics has potential in facilitating the optimization of operation decision-making in chondrosarcoma. Key Points: •Among radiomics studies on chondrosarcoma, although differential diagnostic models showed promising performance, only pieces of weak level of evidence were reached with insufficient study quality. •Since the RQS rating, the TRIPOD checklist, and the IBSI guideline have largely overlapped with each other, it is necessary to establish one widely acceptable methodological and reporting guideline for radiomics research. •The TRIPOD model typing, the phase classification of image mining studies, and the level of evidence category are useful tools to assess the gap between academic research and clinical application, although their modifications for radiomics studies are needed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.},

  abstract={Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition whose symptoms, severity, and progression over time vary enormously among individuals. Ideally, each person living with MS should be provided with an accurate prognosis at the time of diagnosis, precision in initial and subsequent treatment decisions, and improved timeliness in detecting the need to reassess treatment regimens. To manage these three components, discovering an accurate, objective measure of overall disease severity is essential. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can contribute to finding such a clinically useful biomarker of MS through their ability to search and analyze datasets about potential biomarkers at scale. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to determine how, and in what way, ML has been applied to the study of MS biomarkers on data from sources other than magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: Systematic searches through eight databases were conducted for literature published in 2014–2020 on MS and specified ML algorithms. Results: Of the 1, 052 returned papers, 66 met the inclusion criteria. All included papers addressed developing classifiers for MS identification or measuring its progression, typically, using hold-out evaluation on subsets of fewer than 200 participants with MS. These classifiers focused on biomarkers of MS, ranging from those derived from omics and phenotypical data (34.5% clinical, 33.3% biological, 23.0% physiological, and 9.2% drug response). Algorithmic choices were dependent on both the amount of data available for supervised ML (91.5%; 49.2% classification and 42.3% regression) and the requirement to be able to justify the resulting decision-making principles in healthcare settings. Therefore, algorithms based on decision trees and support vector machines were commonly used, and the maximum average performance of 89.9% AUC was found in random forests comparing with other ML algorithms. Conclusions: ML is applicable to determining how candidate biomarkers perform in the assessment of disease severity. However, applying ML research to develop decision aids to help clinicians optimize treatment strategies and analyze treatment responses in individual patients calls for creating appropriate data resources and shared experimental protocols. They should target proceeding from segregated classification of signals or natural language to both holistic analyses across data modalities and clinically-meaningful differentiation of disease. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose: Clinical prediction tools (CPTs) are decision-making instruments utilizing patient data to predict specific clinical outcomes, risk-stratify patients, or suggest personalized diagnostic or therapeutic options. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have resulted in a proliferation of CPTs created using machine learning (ML)–yet the clinical applicability of ML-based CPTs and their validation in clinical settings remain unclear. This systematic review aims to compare the validity and clinical efficacy of ML-based to traditional CPTs in pediatric surgery. Methods: Nine databases were searched from 2000 until July 9, 2021 to retrieve articles reporting on CPTs and ML for pediatric surgical conditions. PRISMA standards were followed, and screening was performed by two independent reviewers in Rayyan, with a third reviewer resolving conflicts. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST. Results: Out of 8300 studies, 48 met the inclusion criteria. The most represented surgical specialties were pediatric general (14), neurosurgery (13) and cardiac surgery (12). Prognostic (26) CPTs were the most represented type of surgical pediatric CPTs followed by diagnostic (10), interventional (9), and risk stratifying (2). One study included a CPT for diagnostic, interventional and prognostic purposes. 81% of studies compared their CPT to ML-based CPTs, statistical CPTs, or the unaided clinician, but lacked external validation and/or evidence of clinical implementation. Conclusions: While most studies claim significant potential improvements by incorporating ML-based CPTs in pediatric surgical decision-making, both external validation and clinical application remains limited. Further studies must focus on validating existing instruments or developing validated tools, and incorporating them in the clinical workflow.

  abstract={Pressure Injuries (PI) are one of the most common health conditions in the United States. Most acute or long-term care patients are at risk of developing PI. Machine Learning (ML) has been utilized to manage patients with PI, in which one systematic review describes how ML is used in PI management in 32 studies. This research, different from the previous systematic review, summarizes the previous contributions of ML in PI from January 2007 to July 2022, categorizes the studies according to medical specialties, analyzes gaps, and identifies opportunities for future research directions. PRISMA guidelines were adopted using the four most common databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct) and other resources, which result in 90 eligible studies. The reviewed articles are divided into three categories based on PI time of occurrence: before occurrence (48%); at time of occurrence (16%); and after occurrence (36%). Each category is further broken down into sub-fields based on medical specialties, which result in sixteen specialties. Each specialty is analyzed in terms of methods, inputs, and outputs. The most relevant and potentially useful applications and methods in PI management are outlined and discussed. This includes deep learning techniques and hybrid models, integration of existing risk assessment tools with ML that leads to a partnership between provider assessment and patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHR). © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Modern lifestyles require new tools for determining a person’s ability to return to daily activities after knee surgery. These quantitative instruments must feature high discrimination, be non-invasive, and be inexpensive. Machine learning is a revolutionary approach that has the potential to satisfy the aforementioned requirements and bridge the knowledge gap. The scope of this study is to summarize the results of a systematic literature review on the identification of gait-related changes and the determination of the functional recovery status of patients after knee surgery using advanced machine learning algorithms. The current systematic review was conducted using multiple databases in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, including Scopus, PubMed, and Semantic Scholar. Six out of the 405 articles met our inclusion criteria and were directly related to the quantification of the recovery status using machine learning and gait data. The results were interpreted using appropriate metrics. The results demonstrated a recent increase in the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques that can provide robust decision-making support during personalized post-treatment interventions for knee-surgery patients. © 2022 by the authors.},

Methods: The authors carried out a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations for a review article. PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus Full Text were searched from January 2015 to February 2021. Results: There are twelve studies included in this systematic review. Fifteen algorithms were used in the included studies. The most common forms of machine learning (ML) used to classify stroke patients were the support vector machine (SVM) (n = 8 studies), followed by random forest (RF) (n = 7 studies), decision tree (DT) (n = 4 studies), gradient boosting (GB) (n = 4 studies), neural networks (NNs) (n = 3 studies), deep learning (n = 2 studies), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) (n = 2 studies), respectively. Forty-four features of inputs were used in the included studies, and age and gender are the most common features in the ML model. Discussion: There is no single algorithm that performed better or worse than all others at classifying patients with stroke, in part because different input data require different algorithms to achieve optimal outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract={Estimating pre-operative mortality risk may inform clinical decision-making for peri-operative care. However, pre-operative mortality risk prediction models are rarely implemented in routine clinical practice. High predictive accuracy and clinical usability are essential for acceptance and clinical implementation. In this systematic review, we identified and appraised prediction models for 30-day postoperative mortality in non-cardiac surgical cohorts. PubMed and Embase were searched up to December 2022 for studies investigating pre-operative prediction models for 30-day mortality. We assessed predictive performance in terms of discrimination and calibration. Risk of bias was evaluated using a tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability of prediction model studies. To further inform potential adoption, we also assessed clinical usability for selected models. In all, 15 studies evaluating 10 prediction models were included. Discrimination ranged from a c-statistic of 0.82 (MySurgeryRisk) to 0.96 (extreme gradient boosting machine learning model). Calibration was reported in only six studies. Model performance was highest for the surgical outcome risk tool (SORT) and its external validations. Clinical usability was highest for the surgical risk pre-operative assessment system. The SORT and risk quantification index also scored high on clinical usability. We found unclear or high risk of bias in the development of all models. The SORT showed the best combination of predictive performance and clinical usability and has been externally validated in several heterogeneous cohorts. To improve clinical uptake, full integration of reliable models with sufficient face validity within the electronic health record is imperative. © 2023 The Authors.

The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic review on the state of the research in the field of Industry 4.0 impact on improving quality management aspects and how technology can be leveraged to enhance its practices. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of the literature published in the last 5 years is conducted. 52 papers were selected, mapped based on the technology they focused on and categorized based on the addressed quality aspects. Findings: The review revealed various areas where quality management can benefit from Industry 4.0 technologies, identified several research gaps and suggested new directions for future research. Firstly, the literature provided some insights about industry 4.0 potential contributions but lacks further detail on the exact applications and solutions through use cases and case studies. Secondly, there has been a focus on the potential benefits provided for quality control while there is a clear scarcity in terms of the other quality management tools and methodologies. Thirdly, there is a lack of studies on economic analysis or detailed impacts on quality costs that justifies the substantial investments needed. Finally, there is a need for including more studies about the mapping and integration of ISO 9001 requirements and Industry 4.0 features. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive review on the ways industry 4.0 technologies can be leveraged for the field of quality management. Based on this review, several directions for further research in this area are identified. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract={Background: Microsurgical free tissue transfer (FTT) is a widely employed surgical modality utilized for reconstruction of a broad range of defects, including head and neck, extremity, and breast. Flap survival is reported to be 90%–95%. When FTT fails, salvage procedures aim at establishing reperfusion while limiting ischemia time—with salvage rates between 22% and 67%. There are limited data-driven predictors of successful salvage present in the literature. This systematic review aims to identify predictors of flap salvage. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted per PRISMA guidelines. Articles included in the final analysis were limited to those investigating FTT salvage procedures and included factors impacting outcomes. Cohort and case series (>5 flaps) studies up until March 2021 were included. Chi-square tests and linear regression modeling was completed for analysis. Results: The patient-specific factors significantly associated with salvage included the absence of hypercoagulability (p <.00001) and no previous salvage attempts (p <.00001). Case-specific factors significantly associated with salvage included trunk/breast flaps (p <.00001), fasciocutaneous/osteocutaneous flaps (p =.006), venous compromise (p <.00001), and shorter time from index procedure to salvage attempt (R =.746). Radiation in the head and neck population was significantly associated with flap salvage failure. Conclusions: Given the complexity and challenges surrounding free flap salvage procedures, the goal of this manuscript was to present data helping guide surgical decision-making. Based on our findings, patients without documented hypercoagulability, no previous salvage attempts, fasciocutaneous/osteocutaneous flaps, trunk/breast flaps, and a shorter time interval post-index operation are the best candidates for a salvage attempt. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: In the past decade, interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in radiology to improve diagnostic procedures increased. AI has potential benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain, from the prescription of diagnostic tests to the communication of test reports. The use of AI in the field of radiology also poses challenges in doctor–patient communication at the time of the diagnosis. This systematic review focuses on the patient role and the interpersonal skills between patients and physicians when AI is implemented in cancer diagnosis communication. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Scopus, and PsycNet from 1990 to 2021. The search terms were: (“artificial intelligence” or “intelligence machine”) and “communication” “radiology” and “oncology diagnosis”. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results: 517 records were identified, and 5 papers met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Most of the articles emphasized the success of the technological support of AI in radiology at the expense of patient trust in AI and patient-centered communication in cancer disease. Practical implications and future guidelines were discussed according to the results. Conclusions: AI has proven to be beneficial in helping clinicians with diagnosis. Future research may improve patients’ trust through adequate information about the advantageous use of AI and an increase in medical compliance with adequate training on doctor–patient diagnosis communication. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Older adults are characterized by profound clinical heterogeneity. When designing and delivering interventions, there exist multiple approaches to account for heterogeneity. We present the results of a systematic review of data-driven, personalized interventions in older adults, which serves as a use case to distinguish the conceptual and methodologic differences between individualized intervention delivery and precision health-derived interventions. We define individualized interventions as those where all participants received the same parent intervention, modified on a case-by-case basis and using an evidence-based protocol, supplemented by clinical judgment as appropriate, while precision health-derived interventions are those that tailor care to individuals whereby the strategy for how to tailor care was determined through data-driven, precision health analytics. We discuss how their integration may offer new opportunities for analytics-based geriatric medicine that accommodates individual heterogeneity but allows for more flexible and resource-efficient population-level scaling. © 2022 The American Geriatrics Society.},

  abstract={Online assessment is defined as a systematic method of gathering information about a learner and learning processes to draw inferences about the learner’s dispositions. Online assessments provide opportunities for meaningful feedback and interactive support for learners as well as possible influences on the engagement of learners and learning outcomes. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify and synthesize original research studies focusing on online assessments in higher education. Out of an initial set of 4,290 publications, a final sample of 114 key publications was identified, according to predefined inclusion criteria. The synthesis yielded four main categories of online assessment modes: peer, teacher, automated, and self-assessment. The synthesis of findings supports the assumption that online assessments have promising potential in supporting and improving online learning processes and outcomes. A summary of success factors for implementing online assessments includes instructional support as well as clear-defined assessment criteria. Future research may focus on online assessments harnessing formative and summative data from stakeholders and learning environments to facilitate learning processes in real-time and help decision-makers to improve learning environments, i.e., analytics-driven assessment. © 2023, The Online Learning Consortium.

  abstract={Purpose: To review the literature on the application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence (AI) for analysis of biofluid biomarkers in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and their potential utility in clinical decision-making. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for articles reporting on AI or bioinformatics in RVO involving biofluids from inception to August 2021. Simple AI was categorized as logistics regressions of any type. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Results: Among 10,264 studies screened, 14 eligible articles, encompassing 578 RVO patients, met the inclusion criteria. The use and reporting of AI and bioinformatics was heterogenous. Four articles performed proteomic analyses, two of which integrated AI tools such as discriminant analysis, probabilistic clustering, and string pathway analysis. A metabolomic study used AI tools for clustering, classification, and predictive modeling such as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. However, most studies used simple AI (n = 9). Vitreous humor sample levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and aqueous humor levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and IL-8 were implicated in the pathogenesis of branch RVO with macular edema. IL-6 and VEGF may predict visual acuity after intravitreal injections or vitrectomy, respectively. Metabolomics and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis identified the metabolic signature of central RVO to be related to lower aqueous humor concentration of carbohydrates and amino acids. Risk of bias was low or moderate for included studies. Conclusion: Bioinformatics has applications for analysis of proteomics and metabolomics present in biofluids in RVO with AI for clinical decision-making and advancing the future of RVO precision medicine. However, multiple limitations such as simple AI use, small sample volume, inconsistent feasibility of office-based sampling, lack of longitudinal follow-up, lack of sampling before and after RVO, and lack of healthy controls must be addressed in future studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Technologies and teaching practices can provide a rich log data, which enables learning analytics (LA) to bring new insights into the learning process for ultimately enhancing student success. This type of data has been used to discover student online learning patterns, relationships between online learning behaviors and assessment performance. Previous studies have provided empirical evidence that not all log variables were significantly associated with student academic achievement and the relationships varied across courses. Therefore, this study employs a systematic review with meta-analysis method to provide a comprehensive review of the log variables that have an impact on student academic achievement. We searched six databases and reviewed 88 relevant empirical studies published from 2010 to 2021 for an in-depth analysis. The results show different types of log variables and the learning contexts investigated in the reviewed studies. We also included four moderating factors to do moderator analyses. A further significance test was performed to test the difference of effect size among different types of log variables. Limitations and future research expectations are provided subsequently. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Significant relationship between active engagement in online courses and academic achievement was identified in a number of previous studies. Researchers have reviewed the literature to examine different aspects of applying LA to gain insights for monitoring student learning in digital environments (eg, data sources, data analysis techniques). What this paper adds Presents a new perspective of the log variables, which provides a reliable quantitative conclusion of log variables in predicting student academic achievement. Conducted subgroup analysis, examined four potential moderating variables and identified their moderating effect on several log variables such as regularity of study interval, number of online sessions, time-on-task, starting late and late submission. Compared the effect of generic and course-specific, basic and elaborated log variables, and found significant difference between the basic and elaborated. Implications for practice and/or policy A depth of understanding of these log variables may enable researchers to build robust prediction models. It can guide the instructors to timely adjust teaching strategies according to their online learning behaviors. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.},

  abstract={Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and deadly brain tumor with late diagnoses and poor prognoses. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that can create highly accurate diagnostic and prognostic prediction models. This paper aimed to systematically search the literature on ML for GBM metabolism and assess recent advancements. A literature search was performed using predetermined search terms. Articles describing the use of an ML algorithm for GBM metabolism were included. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis: diagnostic (n = 3, 30%), prognostic (n = 6, 60%), or both (n = 1, 10%). Most studies analyzed data from multiple databases, while 50% (n = 5) included additional original samples. At least 2536 data samples were run through an ML algorithm. Twenty-seven ML algorithms were recorded with a mean of 2.8 algorithms per study. Algorithms were supervised (n = 24, 89%), unsupervised (n = 3, 11%), continuous (n = 19, 70%), or categorical (n = 8, 30%). The mean reported accuracy and AUC of ROC were 95.63% and 0.779, respectively. One hundred six metabolic markers were identified, but only EMP3 was reported in multiple studies. Many studies have identified potential biomarkers for GBM diagnosis and prognostication. These algorithms show promise; however, a consensus on even a handful of biomarkers has not yet been made. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Objectives Motor neuron disease (MND) is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. There is a pressing need for innovation in identifying therapies to take to clinical trial. Here, we detail a systematic and structured evidence-based approach to inform consensus decision making to select the first two drugs for evaluation in Motor Neuron Disease-Systematic Multi-arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART: NCT04302870), an adaptive platform trial. We aim to identify and prioritise candidate drugs which have the best available evidence for efficacy, acceptable safety profiles and are feasible for evaluation within the trial protocol. Methods We conducted a two-stage systematic review to identify potential neuroprotective interventions. First, we reviewed clinical studies in MND, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, identifying drugs described in at least one MND publication or publications in two or more other diseases. We scored and ranked drugs using a metric evaluating safety, efficacy, study size and study quality. In stage two, we reviewed efficacy of drugs in MND animal models, multicellular eukaryotic models and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) studies. An expert panel reviewed candidate drugs over two shortlisting rounds and a final selection round, considering the systematic review findings, late breaking evidence, mechanistic plausibility, safety, tolerability and feasibility of evaluation in MND-SMART. Results From the clinical review, we identified 595 interventions. 66 drugs met our drug/disease logic. Of these, 22 drugs with supportive clinical and preclinical evidence were shortlisted at round 1. Seven drugs proceeded to round 2. The panel reached a consensus to evaluate memantine and trazodone as the first two arms of MND-SMART. Discussion For future drug selection, we will incorporate automation tools, text-mining and machine learning techniques to the systematic reviews and consider data generated from other domains, including high-throughput phenotypic screening of human iPSCs.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

  abstract={During the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient care delivery paradigm rapidly shifted to remote technological solutions. Rising rates of life expectancy of older people, and deaths due to chronic diseases (CDs) such as cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease pose many challenges to healthcare. While the feasibility of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) with a Smart Healthcare Monitoring (SHM) framework was somewhat questionable before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now a proven commodity and is on its way to becoming ubiquitous. More health organizations are adopting RPM to enable CD management in the absence of individual monitoring. The current studies on SHM have reviewed the applications of IoT and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the domain, their architecture, security, privacy and other network related issues. However, no study has analyzed the AI and ubiquitous computing advances in SHM frameworks. The objective of this research is to identify and map key technical concepts in the SHM framework. In this context an interesting and meaningful classification of the research articles surveyed for this work is presented. The comprehensive and systematic review is based on the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” (PRISMA) approach. A total of 2540 papers were screened from leading research archives from 2016 to March 2021, and finally, 50 articles were selected for review. The major advantages, developments, distinctive architectural structure, components, technical challenges and possibilities in SHM are briefly discussed. A review of various recent cloud and fog computing based architectures, major ML implementation challenges, prospects and future trends is also presented.

  abstract={Background: Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) precipitating sudden cardiac arrest (SCD) is among the most frequent causes of death and pose a high burden on public health systems worldwide. The increasing availability of electrophysiological signals collected through conventional methods (e.g. electrocardiography (ECG)) and digital health technologies (e.g. wearable devices) in combination with novel predictive analytics using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) hold potential for personalised predictions of arrhythmic events. Methods: This systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis assesses the state-of-the-art of ML/DL models of electrophysiological signals for personalised prediction of malignant VA or SCD, and studies potential causes of bias (PROSPERO, reference: CRD42021283464). Five electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Pooled estimates of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary area under the curve (AUROC) were calculated. Meta-analyses were performed separately for studies using publicly available, ad-hoc datasets, versus targeted clinical data acquisition. Studies were scored on risk of bias by the PROBAST tool. Findings: 2194 studies were identified of which 46 were included in the systematic review and 32 in the meta-analysis. Pooling of individual models demonstrated a summary AUROC of 0.856 (95% CI 0.755–0.909) for short-term (time-to-event up to 72 h) prediction and AUROC of 0.876 (95% CI 0.642–0.980) for long-term prediction (time-to-event up to years). While models developed on ad-hoc sets had higher pooled performance (AUROC 0.919, 95% CI 0.867–0.952), they had a high risk of bias related to the re-use and overlap of small ad-hoc datasets, choices of ML tool and a lack of external model validation. Interpretation: ML and DL models appear to accurately predict malignant VA and SCD. However, wide heterogeneity between studies, in part due to small ad-hoc datasets and choice of ML model, may reduce the ability to generalise and should be addressed in future studies.

  abstract={Objective: Despite recent calls for home healthcare (HHC) to integrate informatics, the application of machine learning in HHC is relatively unknown. Thus, this study aimed to synthesize and appraise the literature describing the application of machine learning to predict adverse outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, mortality) using electronic health record (EHR) data in the HHC setting. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the comprehensiveness of predictors used in the machine learning algorithms guided by the Biopsychosocial Model. Methods: During March 2022 we conducted a literature search in four databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were 1) describing services provided in the HHC setting, 2) applying machine learning algorithms to predict adverse outcomes, defined as outcomes related to patient deterioration, 3) using EHR data and 4) focusing on the adult population. Predictors were mapped to the Biopsychosocial Model. A risk of bias analysis was conducted using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: The final sample included 20 studies. Eighteen studies used predictors from standardized assessments integrated in the EHR. The most common outcome of interest was hospitalization (55%), followed by mortality (25%). Psychological predictors were frequently excluded (35%). Tree based algorithms were most frequently applied (75%). Most studies demonstrated high or unclear risk of bias (75%). Conclusion: Future studies in HHC should consider incorporating machine learning algorithms into clinical decision support systems to identify patients at risk. Based on the Biopsychosocial model, psychological and interpersonal characteristics should be used along with biological characteristics to enhance risk prediction. To facilitate the widespread adoption of machine learning, stakeholders should encourage standardization in the HHC setting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={This paper introduces design patterns for dashboards to inform dashboard design processes. Despite a growing number of public examples, case studies, and general guidelines there is surprisingly little design guidance for dashboards. Such guidance is necessary to inspire designs and discuss tradeoffs in, e.g., screenspace, interaction, or information shown. Based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards, we report on eight groups of design patterns that provide common solutions in dashboard design. We discuss combinations of these patterns in 'dashboard genres' such as narrative, analytical, or embedded dashboard. We ran a 2-week dashboard design workshop with 23 participants of varying expertise working on their own data and dashboards. We discuss the application of patterns for the dashboard design processes, as well as general design tradeoffs and common challenges. Our work complements previous surveys and aims to support dashboard designers and researchers in co-creation, structured design decisions, as well as future user evaluations about dashboard design guidelines.

  abstract={Introduction: Machine learning research into automated dementia diagnosis is becoming increasingly popular but so far has had limited clinical impact. A key challenge is building robust and generalizable models that generate decisions that can be reliably explained. Some models are designed to be inherently “interpretable,” whereas post hoc “explainability” methods can be used for other models. Methods: Here we sought to summarize the state-of-the-art of interpretable machine learning for dementia. Results: We identified 92 studies using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies demonstrate promising classification performance but vary in their validation procedures and reporting standards and rely heavily on popular data sets. Discussion: Future work should incorporate clinicians to validate explanation methods and make conclusive inferences about dementia-related disease pathology. Critically analyzing model explanations also requires an understanding of the interpretability methods itself. Patient-specific explanations are also required to demonstrate the benefit of interpretable machine learning in clinical practice. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in predicting the mode of childbirth and assessing the potential maternal risks during pregnancy. The primary aim of this review study is to explore current research and development perspectives that utilizes the ML techniques to predict the optimal mode of childbirth and to detect various complications during childbirth. A total of 26 articles (published between 2000 and 2020) from an initial set of 241 articles were selected and reviewed following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. As outcomes, this review study highlighted the objectives or focuses of the recent studies conducted on pregnancy outcomes using ML; explored the adopted ML algorithms along with their performances; and provided a synthesized view of features used, types of features, data sources and its characteristics. Besides, the review investigated and depicted how the objectives of the prior studies have changed with time being; and the association among the objectives of the studies, uses of algorithms, and the features. The study also delineated future research opportunities to facilitate the existing initiatives for reducing maternal complacent and mortality rates, such as: utilizing unsupervised and deep learning algorithms for prediction, revealing the unknown reasons of maternal complications, developing usable and useful ML-based clinical decision support systems to be used by the expecting mothers and health professionals, enhancing dataset and its accessibility, and exploring the potentiality of surgical robotic tools. Finally, the findings of this review study contributed to the development of a conceptual framework for advancing the ML-based maternal healthcare system. All together, this review will provide a state-of-the-art paradigm of ML-based maternal healthcare that will aid in clinical decision-making, anticipating pregnancy problems and delivery mode, and medical diagnosis and treatment. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Several studies applying Machine Learning to deception detection have been published in the last decade. A rich and complex set of settings, approaches, theories, and results is now available. Therefore, one may find it difficult to identify trends, successful paths, gaps, and opportunities for contribution. The present literature review aims to provide the state of research regarding deception detection with Machine Learning. We followed the PRISMA protocol and retrieved 648 articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. 540 of them were screened (108 were duplicates). A final corpus of 81 documents has been summarized as mind maps. Metadata was extracted and has been encoded as Python dictionaries to support a statistical analysis scripted in Python programming language, and available as a collection of Jupyter Lab Notebooks in a GitHub repository. All are available as Jupyter Lab Notebooks. Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbor are the five most explored techniques. The studies report a detection performance ranging from 51% to 100%, with 19 works reaching accuracy rate above 0.9. Monomodal, Bimodal, and Multimodal approaches were exploited and achieved various accuracy levels for detection. Bimodal and Multimodal approaches have become a trend over Monomodal ones, although there are high-performance examples of the latter. Studies that exploit language and linguistic features, 75% are dedicated to English. The findings include observations of the following: language and culture, emotional features, psychological traits, cognitive load, facial cues, complexity, performance, and Machine Learning topics. We also present a dataset benchmark. Main conclusions are that labeled datasets from real-life data are scarce. Also, there is still room for new approaches for deception detection with Machine Learning, especially if focused on languages and cultures other than English-based. Further research would greatly contribute by providing new labeled and multimodal datasets for deception detection, both for English and other languages. © 2023 Constâncio et al.

  abstract={Objective: We critically evaluated the surgical literature to explore the prevalence and describe how equity assessments occur when using clinical decision support systems. Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are increasingly used to facilitate surgical care delivery. Despite formal recommendations to do so, equity evaluations are not routinely performed on CDS systems and underrepresented populations are at risk of harm and further health disparities. We explored surgical literature to determine frequency and rigor of CDS equity assessments and offer recommendations to improve CDS equity by appending existing frameworks. Methods: We performed a scoping review up to Augus 25, 2021 using PubMed and Google Scholar for the following search terms: clinical decision support, implementation, RE-AIM, Proctor, Proctor's framework, equity, trauma, surgery, surgical. We identified 1415 citations and 229 abstracts met criteria for review. A total of 84 underwent full review after 145 were excluded if they did not assess outcomes of an electronic CDS tool or have a surgical use case. Results: Only 6% (5/84) of surgical CDS systems reported equity analyses, suggesting that current methods for optimizing equity in surgical CDS are inadequate. We propose revising the RE-AIM framework to include an Equity element (RE2-AIM) specifying that CDS foundational analyses and algorithms are performed or trained on balanced datasets with sociodemographic characteristics that accurately represent the CDS target population and are assessed by sensitivity analyses focused on vulnerable subpopulations. Conclusion: Current surgical CDS literature reports little with respect to equity. Revising the RE-AIM framework to include an Equity element (RE2-AIM) promotes the development and implementation of CDS systems that, at minimum, do not worsen healthcare disparities and possibly improve their generalizability. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract={Objective: The objectives of this systematic review are to describe features and specific application scenarios for current cancer survivorship care services of Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven digital health technologies (DHTs) and to explore the acceptance and briefly evaluate its feasibility in the application process. Methods: Search for literatures published from 2010 to 2022 on sites MEDLINE, IEEE-Xplor, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus systematically. The types of literatures include original research, descriptive study, randomized controlled trial, pilot study, and feasible or acceptable study. The literatures above described current status and effectiveness of digital medical technologies based on AI and used in cancer survivorship care services. Additionally, we use QuADS quality assessment tool to evaluate the quality of literatures included in this review. Results: 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed and qualitatively synthesized. The current status and results related to the application of AI-driven DHTs in cancer survivorship care were reviewed. Most of these studies were designed specifically for breast cancer survivors’ care and focused on the areas of recurrence or secondary cancer prediction, clinical decision support, cancer survivability prediction, population or treatment stratified, anti-cancer treatment-induced adverse reaction prediction, and so on. Applying AI-based DHTs to cancer survivors actually has shown some positive outcomes, including increased motivation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), reduce fatigue and pain levels, improved quality of life, and physical function. However, current research mostly explored the technology development and formation (testing) phases, with limited-scale population, and single-center trial. Therefore, it is not suitable to draw conclusions that the effectiveness of AI-based DHTs in supportive cancer care, as most of applications are still in the early stage of development and feasibility testing. Conclusions: While digital therapies are promising in the care of cancer patients, more high-quality studies are still needed in the future to demonstrate the effectiveness of digital therapies in cancer care. Studies should explore how to develop uniform standards for measuring patient-related outcomes, ensure the scientific validity of research methods, and emphasize patient and health practitioner involvement in the development and use of technology. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Breathlessness is a common presenting symptom in practice. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of CDSS on breathlessness and associated diseases in real-world clinical settings. Studies published between 1 January 2000 to 10 September 2021 were systematically obtained from 14 electronic research databases including CENTRAL, Embase, Pubmed, and clinical trial registries. Main outcomes of interest were patient health outcomes, provider use, diagnostic concordance, economic evaluation, and unintended consequences. The review protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020163141). A total of 4294 records were screened and 37 studies included of which 30 were RCTs. Twenty studies were in primary care, 13 in hospital outpatient/emergency department (ED), and the remainder mixed. Study duration ranged from 2 weeks to 5 years. Most were adults (58%). Five CDSS were focused on assessment, one on assessment and management, and the rest on disease-specific management. Most studies were disease-specific, predominantly focused on asthma (17 studies), COPD (2 studies), or asthma and COPD (3 studies). CDSS for COPD, heart failure, and asthma in adults reported clinical benefits such as reduced exacerbations, improved quality of life, improved patient-reported outcomes or reduced mortality. Studies identified low usage as the main barrier to effectiveness. Clinicians identified dissonance between CDSS recommendations and real-world practice as a major barrier. This review identified potential benefits of CDSS implementation in primary care and outpatient services for adults with heart failure, COPD, and asthma in improving diagnosis, compliance with guideline recommendations, promotion of non-pharmacological interventions, and improved clinical outcomes including mortality. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Technology-based, open-ended learning environments (OELEs) can capture detailed information of students' interactions as they work through a task or solve a problem embedded in the environment. This information, in the form of log data, has the potential to provide important insights about the practices adopted by students for scientific inquiry and problem solving. How to parse and analyse the log data to reveal evidence of multifaceted constructs like inquiry and problem solving holds the key to making interactive learning environments useful for assessing students' higher-order competencies. In this paper, we present a systematic review of studies that used log data generated in OELEs to describe, model and assess scientific inquiry and problem solving. We identify and analyse 70 conference proceedings and journal papers published between 2012 and 2021. Our results reveal large variations in OELE and task characteristics, approaches used to extract features from log data and interpretation models used to link features to target constructs. While the educational data mining and learning analytics communities have made progress in leveraging log data to model inquiry and problem solving, multiple barriers still exist to hamper the production of representative, reproducible and generalizable results. Based on the trends identified, we lay out a set of recommendations pertaining to key aspects of the workflow that we believe will help the field develop more systematic approaches to designing and using OELEs for studying how students engage in inquiry and problem-solving practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Research has shown that technology-based, open-ended learning environments (OELEs) that collect users' interaction data are potentially useful tools for engaging students in practice-based STEM learning. More work is needed to identify generalizable principles of how to design OELE tasks to support student learning and how to analyse the log data to assess student performance. What this paper adds We identified multiple barriers to the production of sufficiently generalizable and robust results to inform practice, with respect to: (1) the design characteristics of the OELE-based tasks, (2) the target competencies measured, (3) the approaches and techniques used to extract features from log files and (4) the models used to link features to the competencies. Based on this analysis, we can provide a series of specific recommendations to inform future research and facilitate the generalizability and interpretability of results: Making the data available in open-access repositories, similar to the PISA tasks, for easy access and sharing. Defining target practices more precisely to better align task design with target practices and to facilitate between-study comparisons. More systematic evaluation of OELE and task designs to improve the psychometric properties of OELE-based measurement tasks and analysis processes. Focusing more on internal and external validation of both feature generation processes and statistical models, for example with data from different samples or by systematically varying the analysis methods. Implications for practice and/or policy Using the framework of evidence-centered assessment design, we have identified relevant criteria for organizing and evaluating the diverse body of empirical studies on the topic and that policy makers and practitioners can use for their own further examinations. This paper identifies promising research and development areas on the measurement and assessment of higher-order constructs with process data from OELE-based tasks that government agencies and foundations can support. Researchers, technologists and assessment designers might find useful the insights and recommendations for how OELEs can enhance science assessment through thoughtful integration of learning theories, task design and data mining techniques. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) has seen an increase in application, and is an important element of a digital evolution. The role of ML within upper gastrointestinal surgery for malignancies has not been evaluated properly in the literature. Therefore, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of ML applications within upper gastrointestinal surgery for malignancies. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Studies were only included when they described machine learning in upper gastrointestinal surgery for malignancies. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to determine the methodological quality of studies. The accuracy and area under the curve were evaluated, representing the predictive performances of ML models. Results: From a total of 1821 articles, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies received a moderate risk-of-bias score. The majority of these studies focused on neural networks (n = 9), multiple machine learning (n = 8), and random forests (n = 3). Remaining studies involved radiomics (n = 3), support vector machines (n = 3), and decision trees (n = 1). Purposes of ML included predominantly prediction of metastasis, detection of risk factors, prediction of survival, and prediction of postoperative complications. Other purposes were predictions of TNM staging, chemotherapy response, tumor resectability, and optimal therapy. Conclusions: Machine Learning algorithms seem to contribute to the prediction of postoperative complications and the course of disease after upper gastrointestinal surgery for malignancies. However, due to the retrospective character of ML studies, these results require trials or prospective studies to validate this application of ML.

  abstract={The paradigm of evidence-based medicine requires that medical decisions are made on the basis of the best available knowledge published in the literature. Existing evidence is often summarized in the form of systematic reviews and/or meta-reviews and is rarely available in a structured form. Manual compilation and aggregation is costly, and conducting a systematic review represents a high effort. The need to aggregate evidence arises not only in the context of clinical trials, but is also important in the context of pre-clinical animal studies. In this context, evidence extraction is important to support translation of the most promising pre-clinical therapies into clinical trials or to optimize clinical trial design. Aiming at developing methods that facilitate the task of aggregating evidence published in pre-clinical studies, in this paper a new system is presented that automatically extracts structured knowledge from such publications and stores it in a so-called domain knowledge graph. The approach follows the paradigm of model-complete text comprehension by relying on guidance from a domain ontology creating a deep relational data-structure that reflects the main concepts, protocol, and key findings of studies. Focusing on the domain of spinal cord injuries, a single outcome of a pre-clinical study is described by up to 103 outcome parameters. Since the problem of extracting all these variables together is intractable, we propose a hierarchical architecture that incrementally predicts semantic sub-structures according to a given data model in a bottom-up fashion. At the heart of our approach is a statistical inference method that relies on conditional random fields to infer the most likely instance of the domain model given the text of a scientific publication as input. This approach allows modeling dependencies between the different variables describing a study in a semi-joint fashion. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our system to understand the extent to which our system can capture a study in the depth required to enable the generation of new knowledge. We conclude the article with a brief description of some applications of the populated knowledge graph and show the potential implications of our work for supporting evidence-based medicine. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: The use of electronic algorithms, clinical decision support systems, and other clinical informatics interventions is increasing in critical care. Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a complex, dynamic condition associated with large amounts of clinical data and frequent decisions at the bedside. Novel data-driven technologies that can help screen, prompt, and support clinician decision-making could have a significant impact on patient outcomes. We sought to identify and summarize relevant evidence related to clinical informatics interventions in both PARDS and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for the second Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies of pediatric or adult critically ill patients with or at risk of ARDS that examined automated screening tools, electronic algorithms, or clinical decision support systems. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction using a standardized data extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize evidence and develop recommendations. Twenty-six studies were identified for full text extraction to address the Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome questions, and 14 were used for the recommendations/statements. Two clinical recommendations were generated, related to the use of electronic screening tools and automated monitoring of compliance with best practice guidelines. Two research statements were generated, related to the development of multicenter data collaborations and the design of generalizable algorithms and electronic tools. One policy statement was generated, related to the provision of material and human resources by healthcare organizations to empower clinicians to develop clinical informatics interventions to improve the care of patients with PARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We present two clinical recommendations and three statements (two research one policy) for the use of electronic algorithms and clinical informatics tools for patients with PARDS based on a systematic review of the literature and expert consensus.

  abstract={Background: Falls in older adults remain a pressing health concern. With advancements in data analytics and increasing uptake of electronic health records, developing comprehensive predictive models for fall risk is now possible. We aimed to systematically identify studies involving the development and implementation of predictive falls models which used routinely collected electronic health record data in home-based, community and residential aged care settings. Methods: A systematic search of entries in Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in July 2020 using search terms relevant to aged care, prediction, and falls. Selection criteria included English-language studies, published in peer-reviewed journals, had an outcome of falls, and involved fall risk modelling using routinely collected electronic health record data. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program for Clinical Prediction Rule Studies were conducted. Study content was synthesised and reported narratively. Results: From 7,329 unique entries, four relevant studies were identified. All predictive models were built using different statistical techniques. Predictors across seven categories were used: demographics, assessments of care, fall history, medication use, health conditions, physical abilities, and environmental factors. Only one of the four studies had been validated externally. Three studies reported on the performance of the models. Conclusions: Adopting predictive modelling in aged care services for adverse events, such as falls, is in its infancy. The increased availability of electronic health record data and the potential of predictive modelling to document fall risk and inform appropriate interventions is making use of such models achievable. Having a dynamic prediction model that reflects the changing status of an aged care client is key to this moving forward for fall prevention interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background and Aim: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) are critical and high-risk inherited mental disorders with debilitating symptoms. Worldwide, 3% of the population suffers from these disorders. The mortality rate of these patients is higher compared to other people. Current procedures cannot effectively diagnose these disorders because it takes an average of 10 years from the onset of the first symptoms to the definitive diagnosis of the disease. Machine learning (ML) techniques are used to meet this need. This study aimed to summarize information on the use of ML techniques for predicting schizophrenia and BD to help early and timely diagnosis of the disease. Methods: A systematic literature search included articles published until January 19, 2020 in 3 databases. Two reviewers independently assessed original papers to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct the study, and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) to assess included papers. Results: In this review, 1243 papers were retrieved through database searches, of which 15 papers were included based on full-text assessment. ML techniques were used to predict schizophrenia and BDs. The main algorithms applied were support vector machine (SVM) (10 studies), random forests (RF) (5 studies), and gradient boosting (GB) (3 studies). Input and output characteristics were very diverse and have been kept to enable future research. RFs algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy and sensitivity than SVM and GB. GB demonstrated significantly higher specificity than SVM and RF. We found no significant difference between RF and SVM in terms of specificity. Conclusion: ML can precisely predict results and assist in making clinical decisions-concerning schizophrenia and BD. RF often performed better than other algorithms in supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future psychological ML research. © 2022 The Authors. Health Science Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

  abstract={Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

We provide an overview of the current state of various AI techniques for DME screening, diagnosis, and classification using retinal imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP). Based on our findings, deep learning models have an extraordinary capacity to provide an accurate and efficient system for DME screening and diagnosis. Using these in the processing of modalities leads to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values.

Objective: The objective of this review was to map the available evidence on the multi-faceted determinants of food choice in athletes and describe key influences impacting their choices. Eligibility criteria. Athletes 16 years and over from any country who engage in physical activity with the intent to be competitive. Studies were included if they reported the multi-faceted determinants of food choice as either a primary or secondary outcome. All study designs were considered. Sources of Evidence. This review followed the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. Eleven databases including PubMed, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), PsycNET (APA), Health Collection (Informit), CINAHL (EBSCO), the Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Trove (National Library of Australia), JBI (Ovid), and Google scholar were searched between September–November 2020 and updated in March 2021. Charting of Data Search results were screened with selected studies extracted into a summary table established a priori by the authors. Study quality was assessed using standardised reporting tools for qualitative and quantitative research designs. The scope and quality of evidence was summarised and reported. Results: A total of 15 studies were included. Qualitative research included one research thesis and six primary research studies using both focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative research included one research thesis and seven primary research studies with cross-sectional design using different validated and non-validated survey instruments. No longitudinal or intervention studies were found. The majority of studies have been published since 2018 and conducted across multiple countries with either mixed cohorts of athletes or focused on predominately endurance or team sports. The quality of reporting was variable, particularly for qualitative research. Outcomes suggested that performance and health were relevant to athlete food choice, with varying impact of competition season, the level of experience, the culture of the sport, the cultural background or nationality of the athlete, athlete sex and the food environment. Conclusion: More research is needed on the multi-faceted determinants of food choice in different cohorts of athletes, particularly females. Future research could explore the relationship between food choice, nutrition knowledge and diet quality or the change in food choice across the phase of the seasons and through injury and illness. Use of validated measurement tools and robust reporting will enable critical interpretation of the study methods and outcomes for use in practice.

  abstract={Background: Machine Learning refers to a methodology in the domain of data analytic that automates the systematic building of the model. It permits the discovery of unseen insights from an enormous datasets by means of suitable methods which involve repetitive learning gathered from data devoid of being programmed explicitly. The aim of this work is to explore machine learning strategies that are able to compensate with the weaknesses of existent asthma development predictive models in children. The objective of this review is to identify, compare, and summarize the existing machine and deep learning classification models for asthma prediction in children. Methodology: A substantial number of asthma development prediction models in children, such as conventional methods of risk factors, logical regression, and the hybrid of both statistical methods and risk factors existed. This study was performed following the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA). We carried a search for relevant studies from 2011-2021 using various online databases such as Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed on 23 July, 2021 to extract relevant papers on asthma prediction Models in children using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Result: The weaknesses associated with these existent asthma development predictive models in children include: they cannot be used as an appropriate tool for the implementation of decision support in electronic medical records, reduced clinical impact as well as low predictive accuracy. It was observed that ANN and SVM were among the best-performing algorithms in some machine learning comparative asthma prediction in children. Conclusion: This work concludes that there is a gradual increase of machine and deep learning algorithms for asthma prediction in children and that these approaches have shown greater predictive performance in pediatric asthma than the conventional existing models. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM).},

  abstract={In the field of emergency medicine (EM), the use of decision support tools based on artificial intelligence has increased markedly in recent years. In some cases, data are omitted deliberately and thus constitute “data not purposely collected” (DNPC). This accepted information bias can be managed in various ways: dropping patients with missing data, imputing with the mean, or using automatic techniques (e.g., machine learning) to handle or impute the data. Here, we systematically reviewed the methods used to handle missing data in EM research. A systematic review was performed after searching PubMed with the query “(emergency medicine OR emergency service) AND (artificial intelligence OR machine learning)”. Seventy-two studies were included in the review. The trained models variously predicted diagnosis in 25 (35%) publications, mortality in 21 (29%) publications, and probability of admission in 21 (29%) publications. Eight publications (11%) predicted two outcomes. Only 15 (21%) publications described their missing data. DNPC constitute the “missing data” in EM machine learning studies. Although DNPC have been described more rigorously since 2020, the descriptions in the literature are not exhaustive, systematic or homogeneous. Imputation appears to be the best strategy but requires more time and computational resources. To increase the quality and the comparability of studies, we recommend inclusion of the TRIPOD checklist in each new publication, summarizing the machine learning process in an explicit methodological diagram, and always publishing the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve—even when it is not the primary outcome. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Introduction: Growth of machine learning (ML) in healthcare has increased potential for observational data to guide clinical practice systematically. This can create self-fulfilling prophecies (SFPs), which arise when prediction of an outcome increases the chance that the outcome occurs. Methods: We performed a scoping review, searching PubMed and ArXiv using terms related to machine learning, algorithmic fairness and bias. We reviewed results and selected manuscripts for inclusion based on expert opinion of well-designed or key studies and review articles. We summarized these articles to explore how use of ML can create, perpetuate or compound SFPs, and offer recommendations to mitigate these risks. Results: We identify-four key mechanisms through which SFPs may be reproduced or compounded by ML. First, imperfect human beliefs and behavior may be encoded as SFPs when treatment decisions are not accounted for. Since patient outcomes are influenced by a myriad of clinical actions, many of which are not collected in data, this is common. Second, human–machine interaction may compound SFPs through a cycle of mutual reinforcement. Third, ML may introduce new SFPs stemming from incorrect predictions. Finally, historically correct clinical choices may become SFPs in the face of medical progress. Conclusion: There is a need for broad recognition of SFPs as ML is increasingly applied in resuscitation science and across medicine. Acknowledging this challenge is crucial to inform research and practice that can transform ML from a tool that risks obfuscating and compounding SFPs into one that sheds light on and mitigates SFPs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Head and neck radiotherapy induces important toxicity, and its efficacy and tolerance vary widely across patients. Advancements in radiotherapy delivery techniques, along with the increased quality and frequency of image guidance, offer a unique opportunity to individualize radiotherapy based on imaging biomarkers, with the aim of improving radiation efficacy while reducing its toxicity. Various artificial intelligence models integrating clinical data and radiomics have shown encouraging results for toxicity and cancer control outcomes prediction in head and neck cancer radiotherapy. Clinical implementation of these models could lead to individualized risk-based therapeutic decision making, but the reliability of the current studies is limited. Understanding, validating and expanding these models to larger multi-institutional data sets and testing them in the context of clinical trials is needed to ensure safe clinical implementation.

  abstract={Objective: To identify and synthesise research on applications of natural language processing (NLP) for information extraction and retrieval from clinical notes in dentistry. Materials and methods: A predefined search strategy was applied in EMBASE, CINAHL and Medline. Studies eligible for inclusion were those that that described, evaluated, or applied NLP to clinical notes containing either human or simulated patient information. Quality of the study design and reporting was independently assessed based on a set of questions derived from relevant tools including CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). A narrative synthesis was conducted to present the results. Results: Of the 17 included studies, 10 developed and evaluated NLP methods and 7 described applications of NLP-based information retrieval methods in dental records. Studies were published between 2015 and 2021, most were missing key details needed for reproducibility, and there was no consistency in design or reporting. The 10 studies developing or evaluating NLP methods used document classification or entity extraction, and 4 compared NLP methods to non-NLP methods. The quality of reporting on NLP studies in dentistry has modestly improved over time. Conclusions: Study design heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of studies currently limits our ability to synthesise NLP applications in dental records. Standardisation of reporting and improved connections between NLP methods and applied NLP in dentistry may improve how we can make use of clinical notes from dentistry in population health or decision support systems.

  abstract={Despite improved ancillary investigations in epilepsy care, patients' narratives remain indispensable for diagnosing and treatment monitoring. This wealth of information is typically stored in electronic health records and accumulated in medical journals in an unstructured manner, thereby restricting complete utilization in clinical decision-making. To this end, clinical researchers increasing apply natural language processing (NLP)—a branch of artificial intelligence—as it removes ambiguity, derives context, and imbues standardized meaning from free-narrative clinical texts. This systematic review presents an overview of the current NLP applications in epilepsy and discusses the opportunities and drawbacks of NLP alongside its future implications. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases with a “natural language processing” and “epilepsy” query (March 4, 2022) and included original research articles describing the application of NLP techniques for textual analysis in epilepsy. Twenty-six studies were included. Fifty-eight percent of these studies used NLP to classify clinical records into predefined categories, improving patient identification and treatment decisions. Other applications of NLP had structured clinical information retrieval from electronic health records, scientific papers, and online posts of patients. Challenges and opportunities of NLP applications for enhancing epilepsy care and research are discussed. The field could further benefit from NLP by replicating successes in other health care domains, such as NLP-aided quality evaluation for clinical decision-making, outcome prediction, and clinical record summarization. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract={This study presents a systematic review of the literature on decision support for designing hospital layouts using spatial network analysis and/or simulation modelling. The review includes 102 articles, which are classified into five different categories concerning their layout-related challenges. Specifically, the categories include overcrowding, patient waiting times, visibility & staff interaction, wayfinding & walkability, and other issues such as hospital-acquired infections. The main finding is the cross-referenced table of different performance issues related to the hospital layout to different assessment methods, indicators, and quality criteria. The review suggests prospects for associating hospital design problems/challenges with spatial layout, as well as a framework for developing methods for layout representation, aggregation and relativization borrowing from the fields of transport planning and operations research. The main focus of this study lies in the spatial layout. Viewing the spatial complexity of a hospital as an indoor spatial environment is at least as complex as an urban environment, thus justifying a geographical approach; hence we expand the scope of the literature review to papers that may not directly address hospital design but have relations to spatial decision support systems. © 2023 The Authors},

The goal of this study is therefore centralized around determining the extent to which soft computing techniques have positively impacted the quality of physician care and their effectiveness in tropical disease diagnosis. The study has used PRISMA guidelines to identify paper selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria. It was determined that the highest frequency of articles utilized ensemble techniques for classification, prediction, analysis, diagnosis, etc., over single machine learning techniques, followed by neural networks. The results identified dengue fever as the most studied disease, followed by malaria and tuberculosis. It was also revealed that accuracy was the most common metric utilized to evaluate the predictive capability of a classification mode. The information presented within these studies benefits frontline healthcare workers who could depend on soft computing techniques for accurate diagnoses of tropical diseases. Although our research shows an increasing interest in using machine learning techniques for diagnosing tropical diseases, there still needs to be more studies. Hence, recommendations and directions for future research are proposed. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: The rapid and reliable detection of pathogenic bacteria at an early stage is a highly significant research field for public health. However, most traditional approaches for pathogen identification are time-consuming and labour-intensive, which may cause physicians making inappropriate treatment decisions based on an incomplete diagnosis of patients with unknown infections, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, novel methods are constantly required to face the emerging challenges of bacterial detection and identification. In particular, Raman spectroscopy (RS) is becoming an attractive method for rapid and accurate detection of bacterial pathogens in recent years, among which the newly developed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) shows the most promising potential. Aim of Review: Recent advances in pathogen detection and diagnosis of bacterial infections were discussed with focuses on the development of the SERS approaches and its applications in complex clinical settings. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: The current review describes bacterial classification using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for developing a rapid and more accurate method for the identification of bacterial pathogens in clinical diagnosis. The initial part of this review gives a brief overview of the mechanism of SERS technology and development of the SERS approach to detect bacterial pathogens in complex samples. The development of the label-based and label-free SERS strategies and several novel SERS-compatible technologies in clinical applications, as well as the analytical procedures and examples of chemometric methods for SERS, are introduced. The computational challenges of pre-processing spectra and the highlights of the limitations and perspectives of the SERS technique are also discussed. Taken together, this systematic review provides an overall summary of the SERS technique and its application potential for direct bacterial diagnosis in clinical samples such as blood, urine and sputum, etc. © 2022},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning has been used to develop predictive models to support clinicians in making better and more reliable decisions. The high volume of collected data in the lung transplant process makes it possible to extract hidden patterns by applying machine learning methods. Our study aims to investigate the application of machine learning methods in lung transplantation. Method: A systematic search was conducted in five electronic databases from January 2000 to June 2022. Then, the title, abstracts, and full text of extracted articles were screened based on the PRISMA checklist. Then, eligible articles were selected according to inclusion criteria. The information regarding developed models was extracted from reviewed articles using a data extraction sheet. Results: Searches yielded 414 citations. Of them, 136 studies were excluded after the title and abstract screening. Finally, 16 articles were determined as eligible studies that met our inclusion criteria. The objectives of eligible articles are classified into eight main categories. The applied machine learning methods include the Support vector machine (SVM) (n = 5, 31.25%) technique, logistic regression (n = 4, 25%), Random Forests (RF) (n = 4, 25%), Bayesian network (BN) (n = 3, 18.75%), linear regression (LR) (n = 3, 18.75%), Decision Tree (DT) (n = 3, 18.75%), neural networks (n = 3, 18.75%), Markov Model (n = 1, 6.25%), KNN (n = 1, 6.25%), K-means (n = 1, 6.25%), Gradient Boosting trees (XGBoost) (n = 1, 6.25%), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (n = 1, 6.25%). Most studies (n = 11) employed more than one machine learning technique or combination of different techniques to make their models. The data obtained from pulmonary function tests were the most used as input variables in predictive model development. Most studies (n = 10) used only post-transplant patient information to develop their models. Also, UNOS was recognized as the most desirable data source in the reviewed articles. In most cases, clinicians succeeded to predict acute diseases incidence after lung transplantation (n = 4) or estimate survival rate (n = 4) by developing machine learning models. Conclusion: The outcomes of these developed prediction models could aid clinicians to make better and more reliable decisions by extracting new knowledge from the huge volume of lung transplantation data. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={When COVID-19 spread in China in December 2019, thousands of studies have focused on this pandemic. Each presents a unique perspective that reflects the pandemic’s main scientific disciplines. For example, social scientists are concerned with reducing the psychological impact on the human mental state especially during lockdown periods. Computer scientists focus on establishing fast and accurate computerized tools to assist in diagnosing, preventing, and recovering from the disease. Medical scientists and doctors, or the frontliners, are the main heroes who received, treated, and worked with the millions of cases at the expense of their own health. Some of them have continued to work even at the expense of their lives. All these studies enforce the multidisciplinary work where scientists from different academic disciplines (social, environmental, technological, etc.) join forces to produce research for beneficial outcomes during the crisis. One of the many branches is computer science along with its various technologies, including artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, decision support systems (DSS), and many more. Among the most notable DSS utilization is those related to multicriterion decision making (MCDM), which is applied in various applications and across many contexts, including business, social, technological and medical. Owing to its importance in developing proper decision regimens and prevention strategies with precise judgment, it is deemed a noteworthy topic of extensive exploration, especially in the context of COVID-19-related medical applications. The present study is a comprehensive review of COVID-19-related medical case studies with MCDM using a systematic review protocol. PRISMA methodology is utilized to obtain a final set of (n = 35) articles from four major scientific databases (ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science). The final set of articles is categorized into taxonomy comprising five groups: (1) diagnosis (n = 6), (2) safety (n = 11), (3) hospital (n = 8), (4) treatment (n = 4), and (5) review (n = 3). A bibliographic analysis is also presented on the basis of annual scientific production, country scientific production, co-occurrence, and co-authorship. A comprehensive discussion is also presented to discuss the main challenges, motivations, and recommendations in using MCDM research in COVID‐19-related medial case studies. Lastly, we identify critical research gaps with their corresponding solutions and detailed methodologies to serve as a guide for future directions. In conclusion, MCDM can be utilized in the medical field effectively to optimize the resources and make the best choices particularly during pandemics and natural disasters. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objectives: Different noninvasive imaging methods to predict the chance of malignancy of ovarian tumors are available. However, their predictive value is limited due to subjectivity of the reviewer. Therefore, more objective prediction models are needed. Computer-aided diagnostics (CAD) could be such a model, since it lacks bias that comes with currently used models. In this study, we evaluated the available data on CAD in predicting the chance of malignancy of ovarian tumors. Methods: We searched for all published studies investigating diagnostic accuracy of CAD based on ultrasound, CT and MRI in pre-surgical patients with an ovarian tumor compared to reference standards. Results: In thirty-one included studies, extracted features from three different imaging techniques were used in different mathematical models. All studies assessed CAD based on machine learning on ultrasound, CT scan and MRI scan images. Per imaging method, subsequently ultrasound, CT and MRI, sensitivities ranged from 40.3 to 100%; 84.6–100% and 66.7–100% and specificities ranged from 76.3–100%; 69–100% and 77.8–100%. Results could not be pooled, due to broad heterogeneity. Although the majority of studies report high performances, they are at considerable risk of overfitting due to the absence of an independent test set. Conclusion: Based on this literature review, different CAD for ultrasound, CT scans and MRI scans seem promising to aid physicians in assessing ovarian tumors through their objective and potentially cost-effective character. However, performance should be evaluated per imaging technique. Prospective and larger datasets with external validation are desired to make their results generalizable. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) regularly experience non-response to treatment for their depressive episode. Personalized clinical decision making could shorten depressive episodes and reduce patient suffering. Although no clinical tools are currently available, machine learning analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise in treatment response prediction. Methods: With a systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of EEG for individual patient response prediction. Importantly, we included only prediction studies that used cross-validation. We used a bivariate model to calculate prediction success, as expressed by area-under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we analyzed prediction success for separate antidepressant interventions. Results: 15 studies with 12 individual patient samples and a total of 479 patients were included. Research methods varied considerably between studies. Meta-analysis of results from this heterogeneous set of studies resulted in an area under the curve of 0.91, a sensitivity of 83 % (95 % CI 74–89 %), and a specificity of 86 % (95 % CI 81–90 %). Classification performance did not significantly differ between treatments. Although studies were all internally validated, no externally validated studies have been reported. We found substantial risk of bias caused by methodological shortcomings such as non-independent feature selection, though performance of non-biased studies was comparable. Limitations: Sample sizes were relatively small and no study used external validation, increasing the risk of overestimation of accuracy. Conclusions: Electroencephalography can predict the response to antidepressant treatment with high accuracy. However, future studies with more rigorous validation are needed to produce a clinical tool to guide interventions in MDD. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021268169. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize surgery in the coming years. Still, it is essential to clarify what the meaningful current applications are and what can be reasonably expected. This AI-powered review assessed the role of AI in colorectal surgery. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library databases, and gray literature was conducted on all available articles on AI in colorectal surgery (from January 1 1997 to March 1 2021), aiming to define the perioperative applications of AI. Potentially eligible studies were identified using novel software powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies dedicated to systematic reviews. Out of 1238 articles identified, 115 were included in the final analysis. Available articles addressed the role of AI in several areas of interest. In the preoperative phase, AI can be used to define tailored treatment algorithms, support clinical decision-making, assess the risk of complications, and predict surgical outcomes and survival. Intraoperatively, AI-enhanced surgery and integration of AI in robotic platforms have been suggested. After surgery, AI can be implemented in the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) pathway. Additional areas of applications included the assessment of patient-reported outcomes, automated pathology assessment, and research. Available data on these aspects are limited, and AI in colorectal surgery is still in its infancy. However, the rapid evolution of technologies makes it likely that it will increasingly be incorporated into everyday practice. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={Regular monitoring of blood pressure (BP) allows for early detection of hypertension and symptoms related to cardiovascular disease. Measuring BP with a cuff requires equipment that is not always readily available and it may be impractical for some patients. Smartphones are an integral part of the lives of most people; thus, detecting and monitoring hypertension with a smartphone is likely to increase the ability to monitor BP due to the convenience of use for many patients. Smartphones lend themselves to assessing cardiovascular health because their built-in sensors and cameras provide a means of detecting arterial pulsations. To this end, several image processing and machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting BP using a smartphone have been developed. Several ML models that utilize smartphones are discussed in this literature review. Of the 53 papers identified, seven publications were evaluated. The performance of the ML models was assessed based on their accuracy for classification, the mean error measure, and the standard deviation of error for regression. It was found that artificial neural networks and support vector machines were often used. Because a variety of influencing factors determines the performance of an ML model, no clear preference could be determined. The number of input features ranged from five to 233, with the most commonly used being demographic data and the features extracted from photoplethysmogram signals. Each study had a different number of participants, ranging from 17 to 5,992. Comparisons of the cuff-based measures were mostly used to validate the results. Some of these ML models are already used to detect hypertension and BP but, to satisfy possible regulatory demands, improved reliability is needed under a wider range of conditions, including controlled and uncontrolled environments. A discussion of the advantages of various ML techniques and the selected features is offered at the end of this systematic review. Copyright © 2022 Haugg, Elgendi and Menon.},

  abstract={Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of mortality, comprising approximately half of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. In the US, the majority of SCD (85%) occurs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and a subset in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), who tend to be younger and whose risk of mortality is less clearly delineated than in ischemic cardiomyopathies. The conventional means of SCD risk stratification has been the determination of the ejection fraction (EF), typically via echocardiography, which is currently a means of determining candidacy for primary prevention in the form of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). Advanced cardiac imaging methods such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) have emerged as promising and non-invasive means of risk stratification for sudden death through their characterization of the underlying myocardial substrate that predisposes to SCD. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on CMR detects myocardial scar, which can inform ICD decision-making. Overall scar burden, region-specific scar burden, and scar heterogeneity have all been studied in risk stratification. PET and SPECT are nuclear methods that determine myocardial viability and innervation, as well as inflammation. CT can be used for assessment of myocardial fat and its association with reentrant circuits. Emerging methodologies include the development of “virtual hearts” using complex electrophysiologic modeling derived from CMR to attempt to predict arrhythmic susceptibility. Recent developments have paired novel machine learning (ML) algorithms with established imaging techniques to improve predictive performance. The use of advanced imaging to augment risk stratification for sudden death is increasingly well-established and may soon have an expanded role in clinical decision-making. ML could help shift this paradigm further by advancing variable discovery and data analysis. Copyright © 2022 Xie, Sung, Saad, Trayanova, Wu and Chrispin.},

  abstract={Objective: Over the last decade, an increase in research on medical decision support systems has been observed. However, compared to other disciplines, decision support systems in mental health are still in the minority, especially for rare diseases like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art digital decision support systems (DDSSs) for PTSD. Methods: Based on our systematic literature review of DDSSs for PTSD, we created an analytical framework using thematic analysis for feature extraction and quantitative analysis for the literature. Based on this framework, we extracted information around the medical domain of DDSSs, the data used, the technology used for data collection, user interaction, decision-making, user groups, validation, decision type and maturity level. Extracting data for all of these framework dimensions ensures consistency in our analysis and gives a holistic overview of DDSSs. Results: Research on DDSSs for PTSD is rare and primarily deals with the algorithmic part of DDSSs (n = 17). Only one DDSS was found to be a usable product. From a data perspective, mostly checklists or questionnaires were used (n = 9). While the median sample size of 151 was rather low, the average accuracy was 82%. Validation, excluding algorithmic accuracy (like user acceptance), was mostly neglected, as was an analysis concerning possible user groups. Conclusion: Based on a systematic literature review, we developed a framework covering all parts (medical domain, data used, technology used for data collection, user interaction, decision-making, user groups, validation, decision type and maturity level) of DDSSs. Our framework was then used to analyze DDSSs for post-traumatic stress disorder. We found that DDSSs are not ready-to-use products but are mostly algorithms based on secondary datasets. This shows that there is still a gap between technical possibilities and real-world clinical work. Copyright © 2022 Bertl, Metsallik and Ross.},

  abstract={Background: Rhinoplasty is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures. The complexity of the nasal structure and the substantial aesthetic and functional impact of the operation make rhinoplasty very challenging. The past few years have witnessed an increasing implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and simulation systems into plastic surgery practice. This review explores the potential uses of AI and simulation models in rhinoplasty. Methods: Five electronic databases were searched: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis as our basis of organization. Results: Several simulation models were described to predict the nasal shape that aesthetically matches the patient's face, indicate the implant size in augmentation rhinoplasty and construct three-dimensional (3D) facial images from two-dimensional images. Machine learning was used to learn surgeons' rhinoplasty styles and accurately simulate the outcomes. Deep learning was used to predict rhinoplasty status accurately and analyze the factors associated with increased facial attractiveness after rhinoplasty. Finally, a deep learning model was used to predict patients' age before and after rhinoplasty proving that the procedure made the patients look younger. Conclusion: 3D simulation models and AI models can revolutionalize the practice of functional and aesthetic rhinoplasty. Simulation systems can be beneficial in preoperative planning, intra-operative decision making, and postoperative evaluation. In addition, AI models can be trained to carry out tasks that are either challenging or time-consuming for surgeons.

  abstract={Background: The incidence of facial skin cancer increases worldwide, resulting in more surgical resections and reconstructions. Reconstructive surgery aims to approach a normal facial anatomy to optimize the quality of life. Objective automated assessment of the esthetic outcome of facial reconstructions could provide feedback for the improvement of surgical techniques and preoperative patient expectation management. Objective: This systematic literature review aimed to assess whether modern technologies can create automated objective measurements of surgical and non-surgical facial interventions outcomes using 3D surface imaging technology. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase, Medline (Ovid), Web of Science, and Cochrane on May 19, 2021. All English literature was collected on surgical and non-surgical invasive facial interventions in which 3D surface imaging technology was used for objective automated assessment of outcomes. Results: Fourteen articles were included in the systematic review. 3D surface imaging technology and automated assessment techniques were found for skin malignancy, cleft lip repair, rhinoplasty, orthognathic surgery, and injectables. Ten 3D surface imaging technology hardware systems and 12 software systems were described. Four studies compared 3D surface imaging techniques to conventional methods. Ten studies used 3D surface imaging techniques for the evaluation of the surgical outcome, without comparison to 2D photography, validated scores, or a panel. Two studies validated the hardware system. Conclusion: This systematic literature review shows that 3D surface imaging technology has the potential for automated objective assessment of facial intervention outcomes. Future studies are necessary to study and validate these tools for standard clinical use in patients with facial interventions. © 2022},

  abstract={Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have a significant impact on human and animal health. VBD has been emerging or re-emerging in a variety of geographic regions, raising alarming new disease threats and economic losses. As a result, techniques based on Artificial Intelligence have been utilized to anticipate vector-borne diseases. Specifically, this study examines the various techniques used in previous studies, including individual and ensemble methods, parameters or variables, dataset types, and performance measures. We examined four databases for scholarly articles published from 2010 to 2021 that discussed prediction models for vector-borne illnesses. The results indicated that increasing air travel and uncontrolled mosquito vector populations were mostly responsible for the population's decline in health. We reviewed a count of 159 studies on the aedes mosquito, the anopheles’ mosquito, the culex mosquito, the triatome bug, the lice, the ticks, the fleas, and the blackflies etc. Our research conducted numerous investigations and summarizes the automated learning techniques utilised in VBD predictive modelling in this article. There is a need for more evidence to ensure that machine and deep learning models can be included in regular diagnostic care. Studies on VBD prediction models should be included to aid practitioners and patients in making medical decisions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).},

  abstract={Background: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery. Early prediction of CSA-AKI is of great significance for improving patients' prognoses. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the predictive performance of machine learning models for CSA-AKI. Methods: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to 18 March 2022. Risk of bias assessment was performed using PROBAST. Rsoftware (version 4.1.1) was used to calculate the accuracy and C-index of CSA-AKI prediction. The importance of CSA-AKI prediction was defined according to the frequency of related factors in the models. Results: There were 38 eligible studies included, with a total of 255,943 patients and 60 machine learning models. The models mainly included Logistic Regression (n = 34), Neural Net (n = 6), Support Vector Machine (n = 4), Random Forest (n = 6), Extreme Gradient Boosting (n = 3), Decision Tree (n = 3), Gradient Boosted Machine (n = 1), COX regression (n = 1), κNeural Net (n = 1), and Naïve Bayes (n = 1), of which 51 models with intact recording in the training set and 17 in the validating set. Variables with the highest predicting frequency included Logistic Regression, Neural Net, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The C-index and accuracy wer 0.76 (0.740, 0.780) and 0.72 (0.70, 0.73), respectively, in the training set, and 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) and 0.73 (0.71, 0.74), respectively, in the test set. Conclusion: The machine learning-based model is effective for the early prediction of CSA-AKI. More machine learning methods based on noninvasive or minimally invasive predictive indicators are needed to improve the predictive performance and make accurate predictions of CSA-AKI. Logistic regression remains currently the most commonly applied model in CSA-AKI prediction, although it is not the one with the best performance. There are other models that would be more effective, such as NNET and XGBoost. Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/; review registration ID: CRD42022345259.

  abstract={As medical science and technology progress towards the era of “big data”, a multi-dimensional dataset pertaining to medical diagnosis and treatment is becoming accessible for mathematical modelling. However, these datasets are frequently inconsistent, noisy, and often characterized by a significant degree of redundancy. Thus, extensive data processing is widely advised to clean the dataset before feeding it into the mathematical model. In this context, Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and their types, are being used to produce a precise and cross-sectional illustration of clinical data. For prostate cancer patients, datasets derived from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), MRI-guided biopsies, genetic biomarkers, and the Gleason grading are primarily used for diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient monitoring. However, recording diagnoses and further stratifying risks based on such diagnostic data frequently involves much subjectivity. Thus, implementing an AI algorithm on a PC’s diagnostic data can reduce the subjectivity of the process and assist in decision making. In addition, AI is used to cut down the processing time and help with early detection, which provides a superior outcome in critical cases of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this also facilitates offering the service at a lower cost by reducing the amount of human labor. Herein, the prime objective of this review is to provide a deep analysis encompassing the existing AI algorithms that are being deployed in the field of prostate cancer (PC) for diagnosis and treatment. Based on the available literature, AI-powered technology has the potential for extensive growth and penetration in PC diagnosis and treatment to ease and expedite the existing medical process. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the neural, behavioral, and physiological systems of the brain. This disease is also known as tremor. The common symptoms of this disease are a slowness of movement known as ‘bradykinesia’, loss of automatic movements, speech/writing changes, and difficulty with walking at early stages. To solve these issues and to enhance the diagnostic process of PD, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been implemented for the categorization of subjective disease and healthy controls (HC) with comparable medical appearances. To provide a far-reaching outline of data modalities and artificial intelligence techniques that have been utilized in the analysis and diagnosis of PD, we conducted a literature analysis of research papers published up until 2022. A total of 112 research papers were included in this study, with an examination of their targets, data sources and different types of datasets, ML algorithms, and associated outcomes. The results showed that ML approaches and new biomarkers have a lot of promise for being used in clinical decision-making, resulting in a more systematic and informed diagnosis of PD. In this study, some major challenges were addressed along with a future recommendation. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background and objective: Aim of nephrologists is to delay the outcome and reduce the number of patients undergoing renal failure (RF) by applying prevention protocols and accurately monitoring chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. General practitioners and nephrologists are involved in the first and in the late stages of the disease, respectively. Early diagnosis of CKD is an important step in preventing the progression of kidney damage. Our aim was to review publications on machine learning algorithms (MLAs) that can predict early CKD and its progression. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and selected 55 articles on the application of MLAs in CKD. PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore Digital Library of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers were searched. The search terms were chronic kidney disease, artificial intelligence, data mining and machine learning algorithms. Results: MLAs use enormous numbers of predictors combining them in non-linear and highly interactive ways. This ability increases when new data is added. We observed some limitations in the publications: (i) databases were not accurately reviewed by physicians; (ii) databases did not report the ethnicity of the patients; (iii) some databases collected variables that were not important for the diagnosis and progression of CKD; (iv) no information was presented on the native kidney disease causing CKD; (v) no validation of the results in external independent cohorts was provided; and (vi) no insights were given on the MLAs that were used. Overall, there was limited collaboration among experts in electronics, computer science and physicians. Conclusions: The application of MLAs in kidney diseases may enhance the ability of clinicians to predict CKD and RF, thus improving diagnostic assistance and providing suitable therapeutic decisions. However, it is necessary to improve the development process of MLA tools. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Nephrology.},

  abstract={Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with multiple available treatments. With the goal of optimizing treatment selection, researchers are developing computational models that attempt to predict treatment response based on various pretreatment measures. In this paper, we review studies that use brain activity data to predict treatment response. Our aim is to highlight and clarify important methodological differences between various studies that relate to the incorporation of domain knowledge, specifically within two approaches delineated as data-driven and theory-driven. We argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach that is only beginning to be utilized in treatment response prediction. The predictors extracted via such models could improve interpretability, which is critical for clinical decision-making. We also identify several methodological limitations across the reviewed studies and provide suggestions for addressing them. Namely, we consider problems with dichotomizing treatment outcomes, the importance of investigating more than one treatment in a given study for differential treatment response predictions, the need for a patient-centered approach for defining treatment outcomes, and finally, the use of internal and external validation methods for improving model generalizability. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

  abstract={There has been an explosive growth in research over the last decade exploring machine learning techniques for analyzing chest X-ray (CXR) images for screening cardiopulmonary abnormalities. In particular, we have observed a strong interest in screening for tuberculosis (TB). This interest has coincided with the spectacular advances in deep learning (DL) that is primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These advances have resulted in significant research contributions in DL techniques for TB screening using CXR images. We review the research studies published over the last five years (2016-2021). We identify data collections, methodical contributions, and highlight promising methods and challenges. Further, we discuss and compare studies and identify those that offer extension beyond binary decisions for TB, such as region-of-interest localization. In total, we systematically review 54 peer-reviewed research articles and perform meta-analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Predicting tooth loss is a persistent clinical challenge in the 21st century. While an emerging field in dentistry, computational solutions that employ machine learning are promising for enhancing clinical outcomes, including the chairside prognostication of tooth loss. We aimed to evaluate the risk of bias in prognostic prediction models of tooth loss that use machine learning. To do this, literature was searched in two electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed; Google Scholar) for studies that reported the accuracy or area under the curve (AUC) of prediction models. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Although both development and validation were included in this review, studies that did not assess the accuracy or validation of boosting models (AdaBoosting, Gradient-boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were excluded. Five studies met criteria for inclusion and revealed high accuracy; however, models displayed a high risk of bias. Importantly, patient-level assessments combined with socioeconomic predictors performed better than clinical predictors alone. While there are current limitations, machine-learning-assisted models for tooth loss may enhance prognostication accuracy in combination with clinical and patient metadata in the future. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: When investigating voice disorders a series of processes are used when including voice screening and diagnosis. Both methods have limited standardized tests, which are affected by the clinician's experience and subjective judgment. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used as an objective tool in screening or diagnosing voice disorders. However, the effectiveness of ML algorithms in assessing and diagnosing voice disorders has not received sufficient scholarly attention. Objective: This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of ML algorithms in screening and diagnosing voice disorders. Methods: An electronic search was conducted in 5 databases. Studies that examined the performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of any ML algorithm in detecting pathological voice samples were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool via RevMan 5 software (Cochrane Library). The characteristics of studies, population, and index tests were extracted, and meta-analyses were conducted to pool the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ML techniques. The issue of heterogeneity was addressed by discussing possible sources and excluding studies when necessary. Results: Of the 1409 records retrieved, 13 studies and 4079 participants were included in this review. A total of 13 ML techniques were used in the included studies, with the most common technique being least squares support vector machine. The pooled accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ML techniques in screening voice disorders were 93%, 96%, and 93%, respectively. Least squares support vector machine had the highest accuracy (99%), while the K-nearest neighbor algorithm had the highest sensitivity (98%) and specificity (98%). Quadric discriminant analysis achieved the lowest accuracy (91%), sensitivity (89%), and specificity (89%). Conclusions: ML showed promising findings in the screening of voice disorders. However, the findings were not conclusive in diagnosing voice disorders owing to the limited number of studies that used ML for diagnostic purposes; thus, more investigations are needed. While it might not be possible to use ML alone as a substitute for current diagnostic tools, it may be used as a decision support tool for clinicians to assess their patients, which could improve the management process for assessment. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Numerous approaches have been proposed across various medical application domains and we observe several similarities across these distinct applications. Despite this comparability, we observe a lack of structured organisation of these diverse research applications such that their advantages and limitations can be studied. The principal aim of this survey is to provide a thorough theoretical analysis of popular deep learning techniques in medical anomaly detection. In particular, we contribute a coherent and systematic review of state-of-the-art techniques, comparing and contrasting their architectural differences as well as training algorithms. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of deep model interpretation strategies that can be used to interpret model decisions.

  abstract={Background: Pressure injury has always been a focus and difficulty of nursing. With the development of nursing informatization, a large amount of structured and unstructured data has been generated, and it is difficult for traditional methods to utilize these data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence and nursing, it has become a new trend to apply machine learning algorithms to build pressure injury prediction models to manage pressure injuries. However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of the method and which of a large number of algorithms for machine learning is more applicable to pressure injuries. Objective: This review aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms for pressure injury management, to further evaluate and compare pressure injury prediction models constructed by numerous machine learning algorithms, and to derive evidence for the best algorithms for predicting and managing pressure injuries. Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic electronic search was conducted in the EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. We included all retrospective diagnostic accuracy trials and prospective diagnostic accuracy trials constructing a predictive model by machine learning for pressure injuries up to December 2021. Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The network meta-analysis was conducted using statistical software R and STATA. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Result: Twenty-five clinical diagnostic trials with a total of 237397 participants were identified in this review. The results of our study revealed that pressure injury machine learning models can effectively predict these injuries. Combining the algorithms separately yields the main results: decision trees (sensitivity: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.84, specificity: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96, diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]: 18, 95% CI: 7 to 49, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), logistic regression (sensitivity: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80, specificity: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89, DOR: 12, 95% CI: 9 to 17, AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.87), neural networks (sensitivity: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86, specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87, DOR: 9, 95% CI: 5 to 19, AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.85), random forests (sensitivity: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.95, specificity: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99, DOR: 56, 95% CI: 3 to 1258, AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), support vector machines (sensitivity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90, specificity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.93, DOR: 19, 95% CI: 6 to 54, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.90). According to the analysis of ROC and AUC values, random forest is the best algorithm for the prediction model of pressure injury. Conclusions: This review revealed that machine learning algorithms are generally effective in predicting pressure injuries, and after data merging, the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for pressure injury prediction. Further well-designed diagnostic controlled trials are recommended to strengthen the current evidence. Registration number (PROSPERO): CRD42021276993. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objective: Artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to play a pivotal role in hepatic imaging. This systematic scoping review summarizes the latest progress of AI in evaluating hepatic diseases based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications, using terms related to deep learning, radiomics, imaging methods (CT or MR), and the liver. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data from each eligible article. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (QUADAS-AI) tool was used to assess the risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability. Results: The screening identified 45 high-quality publications from 235 candidates, including 8 on diffuse liver diseases and 37 on focal liver lesions. Nine studies used deep learning and 36 studies used radiomics. All 45 studies were rated as low risk of bias in patient selection and workflow, but 36 (80%) were rated as high risk of bias in the index test because they lacked external validation. In terms of concerns regarding applicability, all 45 studies were rated as low concerns. These studies demonstrated that deep learning and radiomics can evaluate liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and a series of complications caused by cirrhosis, predict the prognosis of malignant hepatic tumors, and differentiate focal hepatic lesions. Conclusions: The latest studies have shown that deep learning and radiomics based on hepatic CT and MR imaging have potential application value in the diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and prognosis prediction of common liver diseases. The AI methods may become useful tools to support clinical decision-making in the future. Advances in knowledge: Deep learning and radiomics have shown their potential in the diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and prognosis prediction of a series of common diffuse liver diseases and focal liver lesions. © 2022 The Authors.},

  abstract={Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogenous disorder that has a detrimental impact on the neurodevelopment of the brain. ADHD patients exhibit combinations of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. With early treatment and diagnosis, there is potential to modify neuronal connections and improve symptoms. However, the heterogeneous nature of ADHD, combined with its comorbidities and a global shortage of diagnostic clinicians, means diagnosis of ADHD is often delayed. Hence, it is important to consider other pathways to improve the efficiency of early diagnosis, including the role of artificial intelligence. In this study, we reviewed the current literature on machine learning and deep learning studies on ADHD diagnosis and identified the various diagnostic tools used. Subsequently, we categorized these studies according to their diagnostic tool as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physiological signals, questionnaires, game simulator and performance test, and motion data. We identified research gaps include the paucity of publicly available database for all modalities in ADHD assessment other than MRI, as well as a lack of focus on using data from wearable devices for ADHD diagnosis, such as ECG, PPG, and motion data. We hope that this review will inspire future work to create more publicly available datasets and conduct research for other modes of ADHD diagnosis and monitoring. Ultimately, we hope that artificial intelligence can be extended to multiple ADHD diagnostic tools, allowing for the development of a powerful clinical decision support pathway that can be used both in and out of the hospital. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background: Movement disorders can be associated with anti-neuronal antibodies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of cases with documented anti-neuronal antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid published in PubMed before April 1, 2020. Only patients with at least one movement disorder were included. We used random forests for variable selection and recursive partitioning and regression trees for the creation of a data-driven decision algorithm, integrated with expert’s clinical feedback. Results: Three hundred and seventy-seven studies met eligibility criteria, totaling 844 patients and 13 antibodies: amphiphysin, GAD, GlyR, mGluR1, ANNA-2/Ri, Yo/PCA-1, Caspr2, NMDAR, LGI-1, CRMP5/CV2, ANNA-1/Hu, IgLON5, and DPPX. Stiffness/rigidity/spasm spectrum symptoms were more frequently associated with amphiphysin, GAD, and GlyR; ataxia with mGluR1, ANNA-2/Ri, Yo/PCA-1, Caspr2, and ANNA-1/Hu; dyskinesia with NMDAR and paroxysmal movement with LGI1; chorea/choreoathetosis with CRMP5/CV2, IgLON5, and NMDAR; myoclonus with GlyR and DPPX; tremors with ANNA2/Ri and anti-DPPX; and parkinsonism with IgLON5 and NMDAR. Data-driven classification analysis determined the following diagnostic predictions (with probability selection): psychiatric symptoms and dyskinesia predicted NMDAR (71% and 87%, respectively); stiffness/rigidity/spasm and ataxia, GAD (67% and 47%, respectively); ataxia and opsoclonus, ANNA-2/Ri (68%); chorea/choreoathetosis, CRMP5/CV2 (41%). These symptoms remained the top predictors in random forests analysis. The integration with an expert opinion analysis refined the precision of the approach. Breast and lung tumors were the most common tumors. On neuroimaging, cerebellar involvement was associated with GAD and Yo/PCA-1; temporal involvement with Caspr2, LGI-1, ANNA-1/Hu. Conclusion: Selected movement disorders are associated with specific anti-neuronal antibodies. The combination of data-driven and expert opinion approach to the diagnosis may assist early management efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

  abstract={Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a standard tool for the diagnosis of stroke, but its manual interpretation by experts is arduous and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) models for the automatic segmentation and classification of stroke on brain MRI. The heterogeneity of stroke pathogenesis, morphology, image acquisition modalities, sequences, and intralesional tissue signal intensity, as well as lesion-to-normal tissue contrast, pose significant challenges to the development of such systems. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in predictive neuroimaging diagnosis and prognostication. This paper reviews image processing and machine learning techniques that have been applied to detect ischemic stroke on brain MRI, including details on image acquisition, pre-processing, techniques to segment, extraction of features, and classification into stroke types. The main objective of this work is to find the state-of-art machine learning techniques used to predict the ischemic stroke and their application in clinical set-up. The article selection is performed according to PRISMA guideline. The state-of-the-art on automated MRI stroke diagnosis, with a focus on machine learning, is discussed, along with its advantages and limitations. We found that the various machine learning models discussed in this article are able to detect the infarcts with an acceptable accuracy of 70–90%. However, no one has highlighted the time complexity to predict the stroke in the model developed, which is an important factor. The work concludes with proposals for future recommendations for building efficient and robust deep learning (DL) models for quantitative brain MRI analysis. In recent work, with the application of DL approaches, using large datasets to train the models has improved the detection accuracy and reduced computational complexity. We suggest that the design of a decision support system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical data presenting symptoms is essential to support clinicians to accelerate diagnosis and timeous therapy in the emergency management of stroke. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Visual analysis and data delivery in the form of visualizations are of great importance in health care, as such forms of presentation can reduce errors and improve care and can also help provide new insights into long-term disease progression. Information visualization and visual analytics also address the complexity of long-term, time-oriented patient data by reducing inherent complexity and facilitating a focus on underlying and hidden patterns. Objective: This review aims to provide an overview of visualization techniques for time-oriented data in health care, supporting the comparison of patients. We systematically collected literature and report on the visualization techniques supporting the comparison of time-based data sets of single patients with those of multiple patients or their cohorts and summarized the use of these techniques. Methods: This scoping review used the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. After all collected articles were screened by 16 reviewers according to the criteria, 6 reviewers extracted the set of variables under investigation. The characteristics of these variables were based on existing taxonomies or identified through open coding. Results: Of the 249 screened articles, we identified 22 (8.8%) that fit all criteria and reviewed them in depth. We collected and synthesized findings from these articles for medical aspects such as medical context, medical objective, and medical data type, as well as for the core investigated aspects of visualization techniques, interaction techniques, and supported tasks. The extracted articles were published between 2003 and 2019 and were mostly situated in clinical research. These systems used a wide range of visualization techniques, most frequently showing changes over time. Timelines and temporal line charts occurred 8 times each, followed by histograms with 7 occurrences and scatterplots with 5 occurrences. We report on the findings quantitatively through visual summarization, as well as qualitatively. Conclusions: The articles under review in general mitigated complexity through visualization and supported diverse medical objectives. We identified 3 distinct patient entities: single patients, multiple patients, and cohorts. Cohorts were typically visualized in condensed form, either through prior data aggregation or through visual summarization, whereas visualization of individual patients often contained finer details. All the systems provided mechanisms for viewing and comparing patient data. However, explicitly comparing a single patient with multiple patients or a cohort was supported only by a few systems. These systems mainly use basic visualization techniques, with some using novel visualizations tailored to a specific task. Overall, we found the visual comparison of measurements between single and multiple patients or cohorts to be underdeveloped, and we argue for further research in a systematic review, as well as the usefulness of a design space. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Purpose: To summarize and critically evaluate the existing studies for spinopelvic measurements of sagittal balance that are based on deep learning (DL). Methods: Three databases (PubMed, WoS and Scopus) were queried for records using keywords related to DL and measurement of sagittal balance. After screening the resulting 529 records that were augmented with specific web search, 34 studies published between 2017 and 2022 were included in the final review, and evaluated from the perspective of the observed sagittal spinopelvic parameters, properties of spine image datasets, applied DL methodology and resulting measurement performance. Results: Studies reported DL measurement of up to 18 different spinopelvic parameters, but the actual number depended on the image field of view. Image datasets were composed of lateral lumbar spine and whole spine X-rays, biplanar whole spine X-rays and lumbar spine magnetic resonance cross sections, and were increasing in size or enriched by augmentation techniques. Spinopelvic parameter measurement was approached either by landmark detection or structure segmentation, and U-Net was the most frequently applied DL architecture. The latest DL methods achieved excellent performance in terms of mean absolute error against reference manual measurements (~ 2° or ~ 1 mm). Conclusion: Although the application of relatively complex DL architectures resulted in an improved measurement accuracy of sagittal spinopelvic parameters, future methods should focus on multi-institution and multi-observer analyses as well as uncertainty estimation and error handling implementations for integration into the clinical workflow. Further advances will enhance the predictive analytics of DL methods for spinopelvic parameter measurement.

  abstract={The exact nature, harmful effects and aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have caused widespread confusion. Artificial intelligence (AI) science helps solve challenging diagnostic problems in the medical field through extensive experiments. Disease severity is closely related to triage decisions and prioritisation contexts in medicine because both have been widely used to diagnose various diseases via AI, machine learning and automated decision-making techniques. Recently, taking advantage of high-performance AI algorithms has achieved accessible success in diagnosing and predicting risks from clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with ASD because of obscure reasons. According to academic literature, ASD diagnosis works from a specific perspective, and much of the confusion arises from the fact that how AI techniques are currently integrated with the diagnosis of ASD concerning the triage and priority strategies and gene contributions. To this end, this study sought to describe a systematic review of the literature to assess the respective AI methods using the available datasets, highlight the tools and strategies used for diagnosing ASD and investigate how AI trends contribute in distinguishing triage and priority for ASD and gene contributions. Accordingly, this study checked the Science Direct, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, and Scopus databases. A set of 363 articles from 2017 to 2022 is collected to reveal a clear picture and a better understanding of all the academic literature through a final set of 18 articles. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and classified into three categories. The first category includes ‘Triage patients based on diagnosis methods’ which accounts for 16.66% (n = 3/18). The second category includes ‘Prioritisation for Risky Genes’ which accounts for 66.6% (n = 12/18) and is classified into two subcategories: ‘Mutations observation based’, ‘Biomarkers and toxic chemical observations’. The third category includes ‘E-triage using telehealth’ which accounts for 16.66% (n = 3/18). This multidisciplinary systematic review revealed the taxonomy, motivations, recommendations and challenges of ASD research that need synergistic attention. Thus, this systematic review performs a comprehensive science mapping analysis and discusses the open issues that help perform and improve the recommended solution of ASD research direction. In addition, this study critically reviews the literature and attempts to address the current research gaps in knowledge and highlights weaknesses that require further research. Finally, a new developed methodology has been suggested as future work for triaging and prioritising ASD patients according to their severity levels by using decision-making techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background: Risk stratification or progression in prostate cancer is performed with the support of clinical-pathological data such as the sum of the Gleason score and serum levels PSA. For several decades, methods aimed at the early detection of prostate cancer have included the determination of PSA serum levels. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview about recent advances in the discovery of new molecular biomarkers through transcriptomics, genomics and artificial intelligence that are expected to improve clinical management of the prostate cancer patient. Methods: An exhaustive search was conducted by Pubmed, Google Scholar and Connected Papers using keywords relating to the genetics, genomics and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer, it includes “biomarkers”, “non-coding RNAs”, “lncRNAs”, “microRNAs”, “repetitive sequence”, “prognosis”, “prediction”, “whole-genome sequencing”, “RNA-Seq”, “transcriptome”, “machine learning”, and “deep learning”. Results: New advances, including the search for changes in novel biomarkers such as mRNAs, microRNAs, lncRNAs, and repetitive sequences, are expected to contribute to an earlier and accurate diagnosis for each patient in the context of precision medicine, thus improving the prognosis and quality of life of patients. We analyze several aspects that are relevant for prostate cancer including its new molecular markers associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction to therapy and how bioinformatic approaches such as machine learning and deep learning can contribute to clinic. Furthermore, we also include current techniques that will allow an earlier diagnosis, such as Spatial Transcriptomics, Exome Sequencing, and Whole-Genome Sequencing. Conclusion: Transcriptomic and genomic analysis have contributed to generate knowledge in the field of prostate carcinogenesis, new information about coding and non-coding genes as biomarkers has emerged. Synergies created by the implementation of artificial intelligence to analyze and understand sequencing data have allowed the development of clinical strategies that facilitate decision-making and improve personalized management in prostate cancer. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. Correctly classifying skin lesions at an early stage could aid clinical decision-making by providing an accurate disease diagnosis, potentially increasing the chances of cure before cancer spreads. However, achieving automatic skin cancer classification is difficult because the majority of skin disease images used for training are imbalanced and in short supply; meanwhile, the model’s cross-domain adaptability and robustness are also critical challenges. Recently, many deep learning-based methods have been widely used in skin cancer classification to solve the above issues and achieve satisfactory results. Nonetheless, reviews that include the abovementioned frontier problems in skin cancer classification are still scarce. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest deep learning-based algorithms for skin cancer classification. We begin with an overview of three types of dermatological images, followed by a list of publicly available datasets relating to skin cancers. After that, we review the successful applications of typical convolutional neural networks for skin cancer classification. As a highlight of this paper, we next summarize several frontier problems, including data imbalance, data limitation, domain adaptation, model robustness, and model efficiency, followed by corresponding solutions in the skin cancer classification task. Finally, by summarizing different deep learning-based methods to solve the frontier challenges in skin cancer classification, we can conclude that the general development direction of these approaches is structured, lightweight, and multimodal. Besides, for readers’ convenience, we have summarized our findings in figures and tables. Considering the growing popularity of deep learning, there are still many issues to overcome as well as chances to pursue in the future. Copyright © 2022 Wu, Chen, Zeng, Pan, Wang and Zhao.},

  abstract={Importance: Despite the potential of machine learning to improve multiple aspects of patient care, barriers to clinical adoption remain. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are often a prerequisite to large-scale clinical adoption of an intervention, and important questions remain regarding how machine learning interventions are being incorporated into clinical trials in health care. Objective: To systematically examine the design, reporting standards, risk of bias, and inclusivity of RCTs for medical machine learning interventions. Evidence Review: In this systematic review, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection online databases were searched and citation chasing was done to find relevant articles published from the inception of each database to October 15, 2021. Search terms for machine learning, clinical decision-making, and RCTs were used. Exclusion criteria included implementation of a non-RCT design, absence of original data, and evaluation of nonclinical interventions. Data were extracted from published articles. Trial characteristics, including primary intervention, demographics, adherence to the CONSORT-AI reporting guideline, and Cochrane risk of bias were analyzed. Findings: Literature search yielded 19737 articles, of which 41 RCTs involved a median of 294 participants (range, 17-2488 participants). A total of 16 RCTS (39%) were published in 2021, 21 (51%) were conducted at single sites, and 15 (37%) involved endoscopy. No trials adhered to all CONSORT-AI standards. Common reasons for nonadherence were not assessing poor-quality or unavailable input data (38 trials [93%]), not analyzing performance errors (38 [93%]), and not including a statement regarding code or algorithm availability (37 [90%]). Overall risk of bias was high in 7 trials (17%). Of 11 trials (27%) that reported race and ethnicity data, the median proportion of participants from underrepresented minority groups was 21% (range, 0%-51%). Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found that despite the large number of medical machine learning-based algorithms in development, few RCTs for these technologies have been conducted. Among published RCTs, there was high variability in adherence to reporting standards and risk of bias and a lack of participants from underrepresented minority groups. These findings merit attention and should be considered in future RCT design and reporting.. © 2022 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

Researchers have focused on applying these technologies to teacher education, as they see the value of technology for educating. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI and LA in teacher education is necessary to understand their impact in the field. Our methodology follows the PRISMA guidelines, and 30 studies related to teacher education were identified. This review analyzes and discusses the several ways in which AI and LA are being integrated in teacher education based on the studies’ goals, participants, data sources, and the tools used to enhance teaching and learning activities. The findings indicate that (a) there is a focus on studying the behaviors, perceptions, and digital competence of pre- and in-service teachers regarding the use of AI and LA in their teaching practices; (b) the main data sources are behavioral data, discourse data, and statistical data; (c) machine learning algorithms are employed in most of the studies; and (d) the ethical clearance is mentioned by few studies. The implications will be valuable for teachers and educational authorities, informing their decisions regarding the effective use of AI and LA technologies to support teacher education. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) models are emerging at a rapid pace in orthopaedic imaging due to their ability to facilitate timely diagnostic and treatment decision making. However, despite a considerable increase in model development and ML-related publications, there has been little evaluation regarding the quality of these studies. In order to successfully move forward with the implementation of ML models for diagnostic imaging in orthopaedics, it is imperative that we ensure models are held at a high standard and provide applicable, reliable and accurate results. Multiple reporting guidelines have been developed to help authors and reviewers of ML models, such as the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Previous investigations of prognostic orthopaedic ML models have reported concerns with regard to the rate of transparent reporting. Therefore, an assessment of whether ML models for diagnostic imaging in orthopaedics adequately and clearly report essential facets of their model development is warranted. Purposes: To evaluate (1) the completeness of the CLAIM checklist and (2) the risk of bias according to the QUADAS-2 tool for ML-based orthopaedic diagnostic imaging models. This study sought to identify ML details that researchers commonly fail to report and to provide recommendations to improve reporting standards for diagnostic imaging ML models. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify ML-based diagnostic imaging models in orthopaedic surgery. Articles published within the last 5 years were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data using the CLAIM checklist and QUADAS-2 tool, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion with at least two additional reviewers. Results: After screening 7507 articles, 91 met the study criteria. The mean completeness of CLAIM items was 63 % (SD ± 28 %). Among the worst reported CLAIM items were item 28 (metrics of model performance), item 13 (the handling of missing data) and item 9 (data preprocessing steps), with only 2 % (2/91), 8 % (7/91) and 13 % (12/91) of studies correctly reporting these items, respectively. The QUADAS-2 tool revealed that the patient selection domain was at the highest risk of bias: 18 % (16/91) of studies were at high risk of bias and 32 % (29/91) had an unknown risk of bias. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that the reporting of relevant information, such as handling missing data and data preprocessing steps, by diagnostic ML studies for orthopaedic imaging studies is limited. Additionally, a substantial number of works were at high risk of bias. Future studies describing ML-based models for diagnostic imaging should adhere to acknowledged methodological standards to maximize the quality and applicability of their models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of mortality and hospitalization worldwide. The accurate prediction of mortality and readmission risk provides crucial information for guiding decision making. Unfortunately, traditional predictive models reached modest accuracy in HF populations. We therefore aimed to present predictive models based on machine learning (ML) techniques in HF patients that were externally validated. We searched four databases and the reference lists of the included papers to identify studies in which HF patient data were used to create a predictive model. Literature screening was conducted in Academic Search Ultimate, ERIC, Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition and MEDLINE. The protocol of the current systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database with the registration number CRD42022344855. We considered all types of outcomes: mortality, rehospitalization, response to treatment and medication adherence. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the comparator parameter. The literature search yielded 1649 studies, of which 9 were included in the final analysis. The AUCs for the machine learning models ranged from 0.6494 to 0.913 in independent datasets, whereas the AUCs for statistical predictive scores ranged from 0.622 to 0.806. Our study showed an increasing number of ML predictive models concerning HF populations, although external validation remains infrequent. However, our findings revealed that ML approaches can outperform conventional risk scores and may play important role in HF management. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Workplace accidents can cause a catastrophic loss to the company including human injuries and fatalities. Occupational injury reports may provide a detailed description of how the incidents occurred. Thus, the narrative is a useful information to extract, classify and analyze occupational injury. This study provides a systematic review of text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications to extract text narratives from occupational injury reports. A systematic search was conducted through multiple databases including Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct. Only original studies that examined the application of machine and deep learning-based Natural Language Processing models for occupational injury analysis were incorporated in this study. A total of 27, out of 210 articles were reviewed in this study by adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review (PRISMA). This review highlighted that various machine and deep learning-based NLP models such as K-means, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors were applied to predict occupational injury. On top of these models, deep neural networks are also included in classifying the type of accidents and identifying the causal factors. However, there is a paucity in using the deep learning models in extracting the occupational injury reports. This is due to these techniques are pretty much very recent and making inroads into decision-making in occupational safety and health as a whole. Despite that, this paper believed that there is a huge and promising potential to explore the application of NLP and text-based analytics in this occupational injury research field. Therefore, the improvement of data balancing techniques and the development of an automated decision-making support system for occupational injury by applying the deep learning-based NLP models are the recommendations given for future research.

  abstract={Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are common in elderly yet difficult to differentiate on MRI. Their management and prognosis are quite different. Recent surge of interest in predictive analytics, using machine learning (ML) from radiomic features and deep learning (DL) for diagnosing, predicting response and prognosticating disease has evinced interest among radiologists and clinicians. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the deep learning & ML algorithms in classifying PCNSL from GBM. Methods: The authors performed a systematic review of the literature from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central trials register for the search strategy in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to select and evaluate studies that included themes of ML, DL, AI, GBM, PCNSL. All studies reporting on ML algorithms or DL that for differentiating PCNSL from GBM on MR imaging were included. These studies were further narrowed down to focus on works published between 2018 and 2021. Two researchers independently conducted the literature screening, database extraction and risk bias assessment. The extracted data was synthesised and analysed by forest plots. Outcomes assessed were test characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy. Results: Ten articles meeting the eligibility criteria were identified addressing use of ML and DL in training and validation classifiers to distinguish PCNSL from GBM on MR imaging. The total sample size was 1311 in the included studies. ML approach was used in 6 studies while DL in 4 studies. The lowest reported sensitivity was 80%, while the highest reported sensitivity was 99% in studies in which ML and DL was directly compared with the gold standard histopathology. The lowest reported specificity was 87% while the highest reported specificity was 100%. The highest reported balanced accuracy was 100% and the lowest was 84%. Conclusions: Extensive search of the database revealed a limited number of studies that have applied ML or DL to differentiate PCNSL from GBM. Of the currently published studies, Both DL & ML algorithms have demonstrated encouraging results and certainly have the potential to aid neurooncologists in taking preoperative decisions in the future leading to not only reduction in morbidities but also be cost effective.

  abstract={Introduction: Treating severely injured patients requires numerous critical decisions within short intervals in a highly complex situation. The coordination of a trauma team in this setting has been shown to be associated with multiple procedural errors, even of experienced care teams. Machine learning (ML) is an approach that estimates outcomes based on past experiences and data patterns using a computer-generated algorithm. This systematic review aimed to summarize the existing literature on the value of ML for the initial management of severely injured patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature with the goal of finding all articles describing the use of ML systems in the context of acute management of severely injured patients. MESH search of Pubmed/Medline and Web of Science was conducted. Studies including fewer than 10 patients were excluded. Studies were divided into the following main prediction groups: (1) injury pattern, (2) hemorrhage/need for transfusion, (3) emergency intervention, (4) ICU/length of hospital stay, and (5) mortality. Results: Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria; among these were two prospective and thirty-four retrospective case series. Publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2020 and included 32 different first authors. A total of 18,586,929 patients were included in the prediction models. Mortality was the most represented main prediction group (n = 19). ML models used were artificial neural network (n = 15), singular vector machine (n = 3), Bayesian network (n = 7), random forest (n = 6), natural language processing (n = 2), stacked ensemble classifier [SuperLearner (SL), n = 3], k-nearest neighbor (n = 1), belief system (n = 1), and sequential minimal optimization (n = 2) models. Thirty articles assessed results as positive, five showed moderate results, and one article described negative results to their implementation of the respective prediction model. Conclusions: While the majority of articles show a generally positive result with high accuracy and precision, there are several requirements that need to be met to make the implementation of such models in daily clinical work possible. Furthermore, experience in dealing with on-site implementation and more clinical trials are necessary before the implementation of ML techniques in clinical care can become a reality. 2022 Baur, Gehlen, Scherer, Back, Tsitsilonis, Kabir and Osterhoff.},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to personalize treatment strategies for patients with cancer. However, current methodological weaknesses could limit clinical impact. We identified common limitations and suggested potential solutions to facilitate translation of AI to breast cancer management. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and PubMed Central in July 2021. Studies investigating the performance of AI to predict outcomes among patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer were included. Algorithm design and adherence to reporting standards were assessed following the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and correspondence with authors to assess data and code availability. Results: Our search identified 1,124 studies, of which 64 were included: 58 had a retrospective study design, with 6 studies with a prospective design. Access to datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 77% and 88% of studies, respectively). On request, data and code were made available in 28% and 18% of cases, respectively. Ethnicity was often under-reported (not reported in 52 of 64, 81%), as was model calibration (63/64, 99%). The risk of bias was high in 72% (46/64) of the studies, especially because of analysis bias. Conclusion: Development of AI algorithms should involve external and prospective validation, with improved code and data availability to enhance reliability and translation of this promising approach.

  abstract={Introduction: Despite multiple prognostic indicators described for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), its management still continues to be a matter of debate. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from historical data, gather insights, and make predictions about new data using the model learned. Therefore, it can be a potential tool in the field of head and neck cancer. Methods: We conducted a systematic review. Results: A total of 81 manuscripts were revised, and 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 38 were excluded for the following reasons: use of a classical statistical method (N = 16), nonspecific for OCSCC (N = 15), and not being related to OCSCC survival (N = 7). In total, 8 studies were included in the final analysis. Conclusions: ML has the potential to significantly advance research in the field of OCSCC. Advantages are related to the use and training of ML models because of their capability to continue training continuously when more data become available. Future ML research will allow us to improve and democratize the application of algorithms to improve the prediction of cancer prognosis and its management worldwide. © 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract={Objectives: Healthcare is required to be effectively organised to ensure that growing, aging and medically more complex populations have timely access to high-quality, affordable care. Cardiac surgery is no exception to this, especially due to the competition for and demand on hospital resources, such as operating rooms and intensive care capacity. This is challenged more since the COVID-19 pandemic led to postponed care and prolonged waiting lists. In other sectors, Quality Improvement Methodologies (QIM) derived from the manufacturing industry have proven effective in enabling more efficient utilisation of existing capacity and resources and in improving the quality of care. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the ability of such QIM to improve care in cardiac surgery. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection and Wiley/the Cochrane Library according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis methodology. Results: Ten articles were identified. The following QIM were used: Lean, Toyota Production System, Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, Root Cause Analysis, Kaizen and Plan-Do-Study-Act. All reported one or more relevant improvements in patient-related (e.g., infection rates, ventilation time, mortality, adverse events, glycaemic control) and process-related outcomes (e.g., shorter waiting times, shorter transfer time and productivity). Elements to enhance the success included: multidisciplinary team engagement, a patient-oriented, data-driven approach, a sense of urgency and a focus on sustainability. Conclusions: In all ten papers describing the application of QIM initiatives to cardiac surgery, positive results, of varying magnitude, were reported. While the consistency of the available data is encouraging, the limited quantity and heterogenous quality of the evidence base highlights that more rigorous evaluation, including how best to employ manufacturing industry-derived QIM in cardiac surgery is warranted. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Intense training exercise regimes cause physiological changes within the heart to help cope with the increased stress, known as the “athlete’s heart”. These changes can mask pathological changes, making them harder to diagnose and increasing the risk of an adverse cardiac outcome. Aim: This paper reviews which machine learning techniques (ML) are being used within athlete’s heart research and how they are being implemented, as well as assesses the uptake of these techniques within this area of research. Methods: Searches were carried out on the Scopus and PubMed online datasets and a scoping review was conducted on the studies which were identified. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included within the review, with ML being directly referenced within 16 (57%). A total of 12 different techniques were used, with the most popular being artificial neural networks and the most common implementation being to perform classification tasks. The review also highlighted the subgroups of interest: predictive modelling, reviews, and wearables, with most of the studies being attributed to the predictive modelling subgroup. The most common type of data used was the electrocardiogram (ECG), with echocardiograms being used the second most often. Conclusion: The results show that over the last 11 years, there has been a growing desire of leveraging ML techniques to help further the understanding of the athlete’s heart, whether it be by expanding the knowledge of the physiological changes or by improving the accuracies of models to help improve the treatments and disease management. © 2022 by the authors.},

In this paper we intend to provide a comprehensive summarization of these methods. METHODS: We used a systematic approach to perform an extensive review of automated lung segmentation methods. We chose Scopus, PubMed, and Scopus to conduct our review and included methods that perform segmentation of the lung parenchyma, lobes or internal disease related findings. The review was not limited by date, but rather by only including methods providing quantitative evaluation. RESULTS: We organized and classified all 234 included articles into various categories according to methodological similarities among them. We provide summarizations of quantitative evaluations, public datasets, evaluation metrics, and overall statistics indicating recent research directions of the field. CONCLUSIONS: We noted the rise of data-driven models in the last decade, especially due to the deep learning trend, increasing the demand for high-quality data annotation. This has instigated an increase of semi-supervised and uncertainty guided works that try to be less dependent on human annotation. In addition, the question of how to evaluate the robustness of data-driven methods remains open, given that evaluations derived from specific datasets are not general. IMIA and Thieme.

  abstract={Wearable devices are an emerging technological tool in the field of learning analytics. With the help of wearable technologies, an increasing number of scholars have a strong interest in studying the associations between student data and learning outcomes in different learning environments. This systematic review examines 120 articles published between 2011 and 2021, exploring current research on learning analytics based on wearable devices in detail from both descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis reviewed the included literature in five dimensions: publication times of the reviewed literature, wearable devices and data types used in studies, stakeholders, objectives, and methods involved in the analysis procedure. The content analysis aims to examine the literature covered in terms of three categorical domains of educational objectives: cognitive, affective, and behavioral, to investigate the practical applications and potential issues of learning analytics based on wearable devices. After that, based on the overall research content of the reviewed literature, a framework for learning analytics based on wearable devices is present, and its application process is summarized and analyzed for the reference of related researchers. At last, we summarize the limitations of existing studies and present several recommendations to further promote research and development in this field. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Management and consequently overall patient survival is reliant upon early detection, accurate staging and early detection of any recurrence. Ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) play an essential role in the detection, characterization, staging and restaging of the most common gynecologic malignancies, namely the cervical, endometrial and ovarian malignancies. Recent advances in imaging including functional MRI, hybrid imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET/MRI) contribute even more to lesion specification and overall role of imaging in gynecologic malignancies.

  abstract={Tailored treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have not yet completely evolved due to the variety in response to drugs. Therefore, artificial intelligence has been recently used to develop prognostic and predictive models of treatment response (either activity/efficacy or toxicity) to aid in clinical decision making. In this systematic review, we have examined the ability of learning methods to predict response to chemotherapy alone or combined with targeted therapy in mCRC patients by targeting specific narrative publications in Medline up to April 2022 to identify appropriate original scientific articles. After the literature search, 26 original articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Our results show that all investigations conducted on this field have provided generally promising results in predicting the response to therapy or toxic side-effects. By a meta-analytic approach we found that the overall weighted means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.90, 95% C.I. 0.80–0.95 and 0.83, 95% C.I. 0.74–0.89 in training and validation sets, respectively, indicating a good classification performance in discriminating response vs. non-response. The calculation of overall HR indicates that learning models have strong ability to predict improved survival. Lastly, the delta-radiomics and the 74 gene signatures were able to discriminate response vs. non-response by correctly identifying up to 99% of mCRC patients who were responders and up to 100% of patients who were non-responders. Specifically, when we evaluated the predictive models with tests reaching 80% sensitivity (SE) and 90% specificity (SP), the delta radiomics showed an SE of 99% and an SP of 94% in the training set and an SE of 85% and SP of 92 in the test set, whereas for the 74 gene signatures the SE was 97.6% and the SP 100% in the training set. © 2022 by the authors.},

In conjunction with recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, there is increasing research into how machine learning can assist in the detection, prediction and treatment of suicidal behaviour. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the literature exploring machine learning techniques in the study of suicidal behaviour prediction. Methods: A search of four databases was conducted: Web of Science, PubMed, Dimensions, and Scopus for research papers dated between January 2016 and September 2021. The search keywords are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’ in combination with ‘suicidal behaviour’, ‘suicide’, ‘suicide attempt’, ‘suicidal ideation’, ‘suicide plan’ and ‘self-harm’. The studies that used machine learning techniques were synthesized according to the countries of the articles, sample description, sample size, classification tasks, number of features used to develop the models, types of machine learning techniques, and evaluation of performance metrics. Results: Thirty-five empirical articles met the criteria to be included in the current review. We provide a general overview of machine learning techniques, examine the feature categories, describe methodological challenges, and suggest areas for improvement and research directions. Ensemble prediction models have been shown to be more accurate and useful than single prediction models. Conclusions: Machine learning has great potential for improving estimates of future suicidal behaviour and monitoring changes in risk over time. Further research can address important challenges and potential opportunities that may contribute to significant advances in suicide prediction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Hybrid implementation of pedagogical models (PMs) helps to overcome the limitations of a single pedagogical model (PM) when it comes to improving student learning outcomes in physical education (PE). Empirical research on hybridizations has grown substantially in recent years, so the purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the effects and mechanisms of different hybridizations on students’ learning outcomes (i.e., motor, cognitive, affective, and social) in PE. Electronic databases, including ERIC, SCOPUS, EBSCO host, and Web of Science, were used to select intervention studies. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 17 high-quality studies, published in English peer-reviewed journals, were assessed. Results show that there were seven different hybrid models having impacts on students’ learning outcomes, which could be divided into four categories: (1) game performance and technical skills; (2) understanding of tactics and decision-making abilities; (3) motivation, autonomy, and confidence; (4) interpersonal skills, cooperative learning ability, and responsibility. Length of implementation and teachers’ familiarity were the main factors that limit the implementation on hybridizations. Future research should consider quasi-experiments with control groups of hybrids versus single models to figure out the advantages of the hybrid model over the single model; including more evidence from different schools, regions, and countries is necessary. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background and objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has branched out to various applications in healthcare, such as health services management, predictive medicine, clinical decision-making, and patient data and diagnostics. Although AI models have achieved human-like performance, their use is still limited because they are seen as a black box. This lack of trust remains the main reason for their low use in practice, especially in healthcare. Hence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been introduced as a technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by explaining how the prediction is derived, thereby encouraging the use of AI systems in healthcare. The primary goal of this review is to provide areas of healthcare that require more attention from the XAI research community. Methods: Multiple journal databases were thoroughly searched using PRISMA guidelines 2020. Studies that do not appear in Q1 journals, which are highly credible, were excluded. Results: In this review, we surveyed 99 Q1 articles covering the following XAI techniques: SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, Fuzzy classifier, EBM, CBR, rule-based systems, and others. Conclusion: We discovered that detecting abnormalities in 1D biosignals and identifying key text in clinical notes are areas that require more attention from the XAI research community. We hope this is review will encourage the development of a holistic cloud system for a smart city. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Fashion is a global, multi-trillion dollar industry devoted to producing and selling clothing, footwear, and accessories to individuals or groups of people. Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda.

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is often heralded as a potential disruptor that will transform the practice of medicine. The amount of data collected and available in health care, coupled with advances in computational power, has contributed to advances in AI and an exponential growth of publications. However, the development of AI applications does not guarantee their adoption into routine practice. There is a risk that despite the resources invested, benefits for patients, staff, and society will not be realized if AI implementation is not better understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how the implementation of AI in health care practice has been described and researched in the literature by answering 3 questions: What are the characteristics of research on implementation of AI in practice? What types and applications of AI systems are described? What characteristics of the implementation process for AI systems are discernible? Methods: A scoping review was conducted of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases to identify empirical studies of AI implementation in health care since 2011, in addition to snowball sampling of selected reference lists. Using Rayyan software, we screened titles and abstracts and selected full-text articles. Data from the included articles were charted and summarized. Results: Of the 9218 records retrieved, 45 (0.49%) articles were included. The articles cover diverse clinical settings and disciplines; most (32/45, 71%) were published recently, were from high-income countries (33/45, 73%), and were intended for care providers (25/45, 56%). AI systems are predominantly intended for clinical care, particularly clinical care pertaining to patient-provider encounters. More than half (24/45, 53%) possess no action autonomy but rather support human decision-making. The focus of most research was on establishing the effectiveness of interventions (16/45, 35%) or related to technical and computational aspects of AI systems (11/45, 24%). Focus on the specifics of implementation processes does not yet seem to be a priority in research, and the use of frameworks to guide implementation is rare. Conclusions: Our current empirical knowledge derives from implementations of AI systems with low action autonomy and approaches common to implementations of other types of information systems. To develop a specific and empirically based implementation framework, further research is needed on the more disruptive types of AI systems being implemented in routine care and on aspects unique to AI implementation in health care, such as building trust, addressing transparency issues, developing explainable and interpretable solutions, and addressing ethical concerns around privacy and data protection. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Student persistence and retention in STEM disciplines is an important yet complex and multi-dimensional issue confronting universities. Considering the rapid evolution of online pedagogy and virtual learning environments, we must rethink the factors that impact students’ decisions to stay or leave the current course. Learning analytics has demonstrated positive outcomes in higher education contexts and shows promise in enhancing academic success and retention. However, the retention factors in learning analytics practice for STEM education have not been fully reviewed and revealed. The purpose of this systematic review is to contribute to this research gap by reviewing the empirical evidence on factors affecting student persistence and retention in STEM disciplines in higher education and how these factors are measured and quantified in learning analytics practice. By analysing 59 key publications, seven factors and associated features contributing to STEM retention using learning analytics were comprehensively categorised and discussed. This study will guide future research to critically evaluate the influence of each factor and evaluate relationships among factors and the feature selection process to enrich STEM retention studies using learning analytics. © 2022 by the authors.},

Literature provides examples of tools for scaffolding SRL in online environments. In this article, we provide the state-of-the-art concerning tools that support SRL in terms of theoretical models underpinning development, supported SRL processes, tool functionalities, used data and visualizations. We reviewed 42 articles published between 2008 and 2020, including information from 25 tools designed to support SRL. Our findings indicate that: 1) many of the studies do not explicitly specify the SRL theoretical model used to guide the design process of the tool; 2) goal setting, monitoring, and self-evaluation are the most prevalent SRL processes supported through functionalities, such as content navigation, user input forms, collaboration features, and recommendations; 3) the relationship between tool functionalities and SRL processes are rarely described; and 4) few tools assess the impact on learners' SRL process and learning performance. Finally, we highlight some lessons learned that might contribute to implementing future tools that support learners' SRL processes. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly advancing field with increasing utility in health care. We conducted a systematic review and critical appraisal of ML applications in vascular surgery. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to March 1, 2021. Study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers, with a third author resolving discrepancies. All original studies reporting ML applications in vascular surgery were included. Publication trends, disease conditions, methodologies, and outcomes were summarized. Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST risk-of-bias and TRIPOD reporting adherence tools. We included 212 studies from a pool of 2235 unique articles. ML techniques were used for diagnosis, prognosis, and image segmentation in carotid stenosis, aortic aneurysm/dissection, peripheral artery disease, diabetic foot ulcer, venous disease, and renal artery stenosis. The number of publications on ML in vascular surgery increased from 1 (1991–1996) to 118 (2016–2021). Most studies were retrospective and single center, with no randomized controlled trials. The median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.88 (range 0.61–1.00), with 79.5% [62/78] studies reporting AUROC ≥ 0.80. Out of 22 studies comparing ML techniques to existing prediction tools, clinicians, or traditional regression models, 20 performed better and 2 performed similarly. Overall, 94.8% (201/212) studies had high risk-of-bias and adherence to reporting standards was poor with a rate of 41.4%. Despite improvements over time, study quality and reporting remain inadequate. Future studies should consider standardized tools such as PROBAST and TRIPOD to improve study quality and clinical applicability. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Breast cancer is among the most common and fatal diseases for women, and no permanent treatment has been discovered. Thus, early detection is a crucial step to control and cure breast cancer that can save the lives of millions of women. For example, in 2020, more than 65% of breast cancer patients were diagnosed in an early stage of cancer, from which all survived. Although early detection is the most effective approach for cancer treatment, breast cancer screening conducted by radiologists is very expensive and time-consuming. More importantly, conventional methods of analyzing breast cancer images suffer from high false-detection rates. Different breast cancer imaging modalities are used to extract and analyze the key features affecting the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. These imaging modalities can be divided into subgroups such as mammograms, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathological images, or any combination of them. Radiologists or pathologists analyze images produced by these methods manually, which leads to an increase in the risk of wrong decisions for cancer detection. Thus, the utilization of new automatic methods to analyze all kinds of breast screening images to assist radiologists to interpret images is required. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely utilized to automatically improve the early detection and treatment of different types of cancer, specifically breast cancer, thereby enhancing the survival chance of patients. Advances in AI algorithms, such as deep learning, and the availability of datasets obtained from various imaging modalities have opened an opportunity to surpass the limitations of current breast cancer analysis methods. In this article, we first review breast cancer imaging modalities, and their strengths and limitations. Then, we explore and summarize the most recent studies that employed AI in breast cancer detection using various breast imaging modalities. In addition, we report available datasets on the breast-cancer imaging modalities which are important in developing AI-based algorithms and training deep learning models. In conclusion, this review paper tries to provide a comprehensive resource to help researchers working in breast cancer imaging analysis. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Cancer is one of the top causes of death globally. Recently, microarray gene expression data has been used to aid in cancer’s effective and early detection. The use of DNA microarray technology to uncover information from the expression levels of thousands of genes has enormous promise. The DNA microarray technique can determine the levels of thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment. The analysis of gene expression is critical in many disciplines of biological study to obtain the necessary information. This study analyses all the research studies focused on optimizing gene selection for cancer detection using artificial intelligence. One of the most challenging issues is figuring out how to extract meaningful information from massive databases. Deep Learning architectures have performed efficiently in numerous sectors and are used to diagnose many other chronic diseases and to assist physicians in making medical decisions. In this study, we have evaluated the results of different optimizers on a RNA sequence dataset. The Deep learning algorithm proposed in the study classifies five different forms of cancer, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD). The performance of different optimizers like Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Gradient Optimizer (AdaGrad), and Adaptive Momentum (AdaM). The experimental results gathered on the dataset affirm that AdaGrad and Adam. Also, the performance analysis has been done using different learning rates and decay rates. This study discusses current advancements in deep learning-based gene expression data analysis using optimized feature selection methods. Copyright © 2022 Gupta, Gupta, Shabaz and Sharma.},

  abstract={Recommender systems have been widely applied in several domains to make informed decisions by recommending items that might be of interest. Considering recommendation during business process execution is also highly advantageous as the efficient suggestions about possible activities or resources can impact process performance. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in process mining still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges to enable the practical application of research findings and ensure a large-scale adoption of this technique. Accordingly, a systematic review is conducted to provide a taxonomy of the published studies on process-aware recommender systems based on specified criteria, including the type and perspective of recommendation, a list of datasets and evaluation metrics used in the setting of PARS, implementation environments, and different algorithms used in PARS. In this regard, there are various insights extracted from this study: (i) Most studies in the business process analysis domain are of descriptive and predictive nature, (ii) recommendation in process mining is an emerging research area that is being evolving; the majority of proposals relate to 2015 and after that, and (iii) due to the lack of common evaluation protocol, datasets, and metrics, most studies are validated through experiments and prototyping, with less tendency to the practical implementation of a solution regarding real scenarios. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract={Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status assessment is crucial for decision making in oropharyngeal cancer patients. In last years, several articles have been published investigating the possible role of radiomics in distinguishing HPV-positive from HPV-negative neoplasms. Aim of this review was to perform a systematic quality assessment of radiomic studies published on this topic. Methods: Radiomics studies on HPV status prediction in oropharyngeal cancer patients were selected. The Radiomic Quality Score (RQS) was assessed by three readers to evaluate their methodological quality. In addition, possible correlations between RQS% and journal type, year of publication, impact factor, and journal rank were investigated. Results: After the literature search, 19 articles were selected whose RQS median was 33% (range 0–42%). Overall, 16/19 studies included a well-documented imaging protocol, 13/19 demonstrated phenotypic differences, and all were compared with the current gold standard. No study included a public protocol, phantom study, or imaging at multiple time points. More than half (13/19) included feature selection and only 2 were comprehensive of non-radiomic features. Mean RQS was significantly higher in clinical journals. Conclusion: Radiomics has been proposed for oropharyngeal cancer HPV status assessment, with promising results. However, these are supported by low methodological quality investigations. Further studies with higher methodological quality, appropriate standardization, and greater attention to validation are necessary prior to clinical adoption. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={There is a considerable rise in cardiovascular diseases in the world. It is pertinently essential to make cardiovascular prediction accurate to the maximum. A forecast based on machine learning techniques can be beneficial in detecting cardiovascular disease (CVD) with maximum precision and accuracy. The disease's effective prediction helps in early diagnosis, which cuts down the mortality rate. A health history and the causes of heart disease require the efficient detection and prediction of CVD. Data analytics is beneficial for making predictions based on a massive amount of data, and it aids health clinics in disease prognosis. Regularly, a large volume of patient-related data is maintained. The information gathered can be used to forecast the emergence of upcoming diseases. Our study presents a detailed comparative study of Cardiovascular Disease by comparing the various machine learning techniques mainly comprising of classification and predictive algorithms. The study shows an in-depth analysis of around forty-one papers related to cardiovascular disease by using machine learning techniques. This study evaluates the selected publications rigorously and identifies gaps in the available literature, making it useful for researchers to develop and apply in clinical fields, primarily on datasets related to heart disease. The current study will aid medical practitioners in predicting heart threats ahead of time, allowing them to take preventative measures. © 2022},

  abstract={(1) Background: Throughout the history of medical and psychology practice, specialists have worked to improve the quality of treatment and rehabilitation, which has led to the emergence of concepts such as serious games. These tools focus on different areas of intervention procedures, one of which is to help people with intellectual disability (ID). Individuals with ID have problems with executive functions (EFs), which are related to adaptive functioning. Recent studies showed that serious games positively impact cognitive, social, and communication skills in people with ID. The purpose of this study is to analyze the solutions that have been found in EF training for adults with ID in recent years, evaluating them with a number of key parameters and identifying the features and possible problems in the further development of our system. (2) Methods: A review was conducted starting with 573 articles in English related to serious games and selected from studies that had been published since 2015. Finally, 10 were examined in detail as they focused on EFs in adults with ID. They were searched in seven major databases (“Association for Computing Machinery” (ACM), IEEE Xplore database, DBLP computer science bibliography, Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsycInfo). (3) Results: It was determined that the most frequent EFs referred to in the studies analyzed were planning and decision-making, followed by working memory and social cognition, behavioral regulation, flexibility, and inhibition capacity. The basic approach to the creation of support systems was also analyzed in terms of technical and program execution. The trend results’ analysis evidenced improvements in EFs, even though they were not significant. This comprehensive technique enabled the identification of the main features and aspects to be taken into account for further development of our system. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Machine learning is a set of models and methods that can automatically detect patterns in vast amounts of data, extract information, and use it to perform decision-making under uncertain conditions. The potential of machine learning is significant, and breast surgeons must strive to be informed with up-to-date knowledge and its applications. METHODS: A systematic database search of Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, from inception to December 2021, was conducted of original articles that explored the use of machine learning and/or artificial intelligence in breast surgery in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The search yielded 477 articles, of which 14 studies were included in this review, featuring 73 847 patients. Four main areas of machine learning application were identified: predictive modelling of surgical outcomes; breast imaging-based context; screening and triaging of patients with breast cancer; and as network utility for detection. There is evident value of machine learning in preoperative planning and in providing information for surgery both in a cancer and an aesthetic context. Machine learning outperformed traditional statistical modelling in all studies for predicting mortality, morbidity, and quality of life outcomes. Machine learning patterns and associations could support planning, anatomical visualization, and surgical navigation. CONCLUSION: Machine learning demonstrated promising applications for improving breast surgery outcomes and patient-centred care. Neveretheless, there remain important limitations and ethical concerns relating to implementing artificial intelligence into everyday surgical practices. © The Author(s) 2022.

  abstract={IoT-based multimodal learning analytics promises to obtain an in-depth understanding of the learning process. It provides the insights for not only the explicit learning indicators but also the implicit attributes of learners, based on which further potential learning support can be timely provided in both physical and cyber world accordingly. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the usage of IoT data in education and the capabilities of multimodal analysis to provide useful insights for smarter education. In particular, we classify the multimodal data into four categories based on the data sources (data from digital, physical, physiological and environmental spaces). Moreover, we propose a concept framework for better understanding the current state of the filed and summarize the insights into six main themes (learner behavior understanding, learner affection computing, smart learning environment, learning performance prediction, group collaboration modeling and intelligent feedback) based on the objectives for intelligent learning. The associations between different combinations of data modalities and various learning indicators are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.  © 2022 ACM.},

  abstract={Breast cancer is the most common disease among women, with over (Formula presented.) million new diagnoses each year worldwide. About (Formula presented.) of patients initially presenting with early stage disease have a recurrence of cancer within 10 years. Predicting who will have a recurrence and who will not remains challenging, with consequent implications for associated treatment. Artificial intelligence strategies that can predict the risk of recurrence of breast cancer could help breast cancer clinicians avoid ineffective overtreatment. Despite its significance, most breast cancer recurrence datasets are insufficiently large, not publicly available, or imbalanced, making these studies more difficult. This systematic review investigates the role of artificial intelligence in the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. We summarise common techniques, features, training and testing methodologies, metrics, and discuss current challenges relating to implementation in clinical practice. We systematically reviewed works published between 1 January 2011 and 1 November 2021 using the methodology of Kitchenham and Charter. We leveraged Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE search engines. This review found three areas that require further work. First, there is no agreement on artificial intelligence methodologies, feature predictors, or assessment metrics. Second, issues such as sampling strategies, missing data, and class imbalance problems are rarely addressed or discussed. Third, representative datasets for breast cancer recurrence are scarce, which hinders model validation and deployment. We conclude that predicting breast cancer recurrence remains an open problem despite the use of artificial intelligence. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Objectives: Detecting caries lesions is challenging for dentists, and deep learning models may help practitioners to increase accuracy and reliability. We aimed to systematically review deep learning studies on caries detection. Data: We selected diagnostic accuracy studies that used deep learning models on dental imagery (including radiographs, photographs, optical coherence tomography images, near-infrared light transillumination images). The latest version of the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in the studies methods and their performance measurements. Sources: Databases (Medline via PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase) and a repository (ArXiv) were screened for publications published after 2010, without any limitation on language. Study selection: From 252 potentially eligible references, 48 studies were assessed full-text and 42 included, using classification (n = 26), object detection (n = 6), or segmentation models (n = 10). A wide range of performance metrics was used; image, object or pixel accuracy ranged between 68%-99%. The minority of studies (n = 11) showed a low risk of biases in all domains, and 13 studies (31.0%) low risk for concerns regarding applicability. The accuracy of caries classification models varied, i.e. 71% to 96% on intra-oral photographs, 82% to 99.2% on peri-apical radiographs, 87.6% to 95.4% on bitewing radiographs, 68.0% to 78.0% on near-infrared transillumination images, 88.7% to 95.2% on optical coherence tomography images, and 86.1% to 96.1% on panoramic radiographs. Pooled diagnostic odds ratios varied from 2.27 to 32,767. For detection and segmentation models, heterogeneity in reporting did not allow useful pooling. Conclusion: An increasing number of studies investigated caries detection using deep learning, with a diverse types of architectures being employed. Reported accuracy seems promising, while study and reporting quality are currently low. Clinical significance: Deep learning models can be considered as an assistant for decisions regarding the presence or absence of carious lesions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In this review, the authors describe existing chest pain pathways and current issues at the patient and system level, and provide an overview of recent advances in chest pain research that could inform improved outcomes for both patients and health systems. There are multiple avenues to improve existing models of chest pain care, including novel risk stratification pathways incorporating highly sensitive point-of-care troponin assays; new devices available before first medical contact that could allow clinicians to access vital signs and electrocardiogram data; artificial intelligence and precision medicine tools that may guide indications for further testing; and strategies to improve hospital benchmarking and performance monitoring to standardize care.

  abstract={Aim: This study aims to synthesize evidence on nurses' involvement in artificial intelligence research for managing falls in older adults. Background: Artificial intelligence techniques are used to analyse health datasets to aid clinical decision making, patient care and service delivery but nurses' involvement in this area of research for managing falls in older adults remains unknown. Evaluation: A scoping review was conducted. CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLI and PubMed were searched. Results were screened against inclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted, and studies summarized using a descriptive approach. Key Issues: The evidence shows many artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning, are used to identify falls risk factors and build predictive models that could help prevent falls in older adults, with nurses leading and participating in this research. Conclusion: Further rigorous experimental research is needed to determine the effectiveness of algorithms in predicting aspects of falls in older adults and how to implement artificial intelligence tools in gerontological nursing practice. Implications for Nursing Management: Nurses should pursue interdisciplinary collaborations and educational opportunities in artificial intelligence, so they can actively contribute to research on falls management. Nurses should facilitate the collection of digital falls datasets to support this emerging research agenda and the care of older adults. © 2022 The Authors.

  abstract={Psychiatric disorders encompass complex aberrations of cognition and affect and are among the most debilitating and poorly understood of any medical condition. Current treatments rely primarily on interventions that target brain function (drugs) or learning processes (psychotherapy). A mechanistic understanding of how these interventions mediate their therapeutic effects remains elusive. From the early 1990s, non-invasive functional neuroimaging, coupled with parallel developments in the cognitive neurosciences, seemed to signal a new era of neurobiologically grounded diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Yet, despite three decades of intense neuroimaging research, we still lack a neurobiological account for any psychiatric condition. Likewise, functional neuroimaging plays no role in clinical decision making. Here, we offer a critical commentary on this impasse and suggest how the field might fare better and deliver impactful neurobiological insights. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Objective: The objective of this systematic review was (a) to explore the current clinical applications of AI/ML (Artificial intelligence and Machine learning) techniques in diagnosis and treatment prediction in children with CLP (Cleft lip and palate), (b) to create a qualitative summary of results of the studies retrieved. Materials and methods: An electronic search was carried out using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science Core Collection. Two reviewers searched the databases separately and concurrently. The initial search was conducted on 6 July 2021. The publishing period was unrestricted; however, the search was limited to articles involving human participants and published in English. Combinations of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) phrases and free text terms were used as search keywords in each database. The following data was taken from the methods and results sections of the selected papers: The amount of AI training datasets utilized to train the intelligent system, as well as their conditional properties; Unilateral CLP, Bilateral CLP, Unilateral Cleft lip and alveolus, Unilateral cleft lip, Hypernasality, Dental characteristics, and sagittal jaw relationship in children with CLP are among the problems studied. Results: Based on the predefined search strings with accompanying database keywords, a total of 44 articles were found in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science search results. After reading the full articles, 12 papers were included for systematic analysis. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence provides an advanced technology that can be employed in AI-enabled computerized programming software for accurate landmark detection, rapid digital cephalometric analysis, clinical decision-making, and treatment prediction. In children with corrected unilateral cleft lip and palate, ML can help detect cephalometric predictors of future need for orthognathic surgery. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Checkpoint inhibition has radically improved the perspective for patients with metastatic cancer, but predicting who will not respond with high certainty remains difficult. Imaging-derived biomarkers may be able to provide additional insights into the heterogeneity in tumour response between patients. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and qualitatively assess the current evidence on imaging biomarkers that predict response and survival in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in all cancer types. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched from database inception to 29th November 2021. Articles eligible for inclusion described baseline imaging predictive factors, radiomics and/or imaging machine learning models for predicting response and survival in patients with any kind of malignancy treated with checkpoint inhibitors. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS and PROBAST tools and data was extracted. Results: In total, 119 studies including 15,580 patients were selected. Of these studies, 73 investigated simple imaging factors. 45 studies investigated radiomic features or deep learning models. Predictors of worse survival were (i) higher tumour burden, (ii) presence of liver metastases, (iii) less subcutaneous adipose tissue, (iv) less dense muscle and (v) presence of symptomatic brain metastases. Hazard rate ratios did not exceed 2.00 for any predictor in the larger and higher quality studies. The added value of baseline fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters in predicting response to treatment was limited. Pilot studies of radioactive drug tracer imaging showed promising results. Reports on radiomics were almost unanimously positive, but numerous methodological concerns exist. Conclusions: There is well-supported evidence for several imaging biomarkers that can be used in clinical decision making. Further research, however, is needed into biomarkers that can more accurately identify which patients who will not benefit from checkpoint inhibition. Radiomics and radioactive drug labelling appear to be promising approaches for this purpose. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objective: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a grade IV brain tumour with very low life expectancy. Physicians and oncologists urgently require automated techniques in clinics for brain tumour segmentation (BTS) and survival prediction (SP) of GBM patients to perform precise surgery followed by chemotherapy treatment. Methods: This study aims at examining the recent methodologies developed using automated learning and radiomics to automate the process of SP. Automated techniques use pre-operative raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical data related to GBM patients. All SP methods submitted for the multimodal brain tumour segmentation (BraTS) challenge are examined to extract the generic workflow for SP. Results: The maximum accuracies achieved by 21 state-of-the-art different SP techniques reviewed in this study are 65.5 and 61.7% using the validation and testing subsets of the BraTS dataset, respectively. The comparisons based on segmentation architectures, SP models, training parameters and hardware configurations have been made. Conclusion: The limited accuracies achieved in the literature led us to review the various automated methodologies and evaluation metrics to find out the research gaps and other findings related to the survival prognosis of GBM patients so that these accuracies can be improved in future. Finally, the paper provides the most promising future research directions to improve the performance of automated SP techniques and increase their clinical relevance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.},

  abstract={Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) is an excellent molecular imaging technique for prostate cancer. Currently, PSMA PET for patients with primary prostate cancer is supplementary to conventional imaging techniques, according to guidelines. This supplementary function of PSMA PET is due to a lack of systematic review of its strengths, limitations, and potential development direction. Thus, we review PSMA ligands, detection, T, N, and M staging, treatment management, and false results of PSMA PET in clinical studies. We also discuss the strengths and challenges of PSMA PET. PSMA PET can greatly increase the detection rate of prostate cancer and accuracy of T/N/M staging, which facilitates more appropriate treatment for primary prostate cancer. Lastly, we propose that PSMA PET could become the first-line imaging modality for primary prostate cancer, and we describe its potential expanded application. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.

  abstract={Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely utilized to support critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance CRRT delivery, but evidence is limited. We reviewed existing literature on the utilization of AI in CRRT with the objective of identifying current gaps in evidence and research considerations. We conducted a scoping review focusing on the development or use of AI-based tools in patients receiving CRRT. Ten papers were identified; 6 of 10 (60%) published in 2021, and 6 of 10 (60%) focused on machine learning models to augment CRRT delivery. All innovations were in the design/early validation phase of development. Primary research interests focused on early indicators of CRRT need, prognostication of mortality and kidney recovery, and identification of risk factors for mortality. Secondary research priorities included dynamic CRRT monitoring, predicting CRRT-related complications, and automated data pooling for point-of-care analysis. Literature gaps included prospective validation and implementation, biases ascertainment, and evaluation of AI-generated health care disparities. Research on AI applications to enhance CRRT delivery has grown exponentially in the last years, but the field remains premature. There is a need to evaluate how these applications could enhance bedside decision-making capacity and assist structure and processes of CRRT delivery. © 2022 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

  abstract={Objectives: This current systematic review sought to identify and evaluate all current research-based spine surgery applications of AI/ML in optimizing preoperative patient selection, as well as predicting and managing postoperative outcomes and complications. Methods: A comprehensive search of publications was conducted through the EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed databases using relevant keywords to maximize the sensitivity of the search. No limits were placed on level of evidence or timing of the study. Findings were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines Results: After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 41 studies were included in this review. Bayesian networks had the highest average AUC (.80), and neural networks had the best accuracy (83.0%), sensitivity (81.5%), and specificity (71.8%). Preoperative planning/cost prediction models (.89,82.2%) and discharge/length of stay models (.80,78.0%) each reported significantly higher average AUC and accuracy compared to readmissions/reoperation prediction models (.67,70.2%) (P <.001, P =.005, respectively). Model performance also significantly varied across postoperative management applications for average AUC and accuracy values (P <.001, P <.027, respectively). Conclusions: Generally, authors of the reviewed studies concluded that AI/ML offers a potentially beneficial tool for providers to optimize patient care and improve cost-efficiency. More specifically, AI/ML models performed best, on average, when optimizing preoperative patient selection and planning and predicting costs, hospital discharge, and length of stay. However, models were not as accurate in predicting postoperative complications, adverse events, and readmissions and reoperations. An understanding of AI/ML-based applications is becoming increasingly important, particularly in spine surgery, as the volume of reported literature, technology accessibility, and clinical applications continue to rapidly expand. © The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract={Real-time mental stress monitoring from surgeons and surgical staff in operating rooms may reduce surgical injuries, improve performance and quality of medical care, and accelerate implementation of stress-management strategies. Motivated by the increase in usage of objective and subjective metrics for cognitive monitoring and by the gap in reviews of experimental design setups and data analytics, a systematic review of 71 studies on mental stress and workload measurement in surgical settings, published in 2001-2020, is presented. Almost 61% of selected papers used both objective and subjective measures, followed by 25% that only administered subjective tools - mostly consisting of validated instruments and customized surveys. An overall increase in the total number of publications on intraoperative stress assessment was observed from mid-2010 s along with a momentum in the use of both subjective and real-time objective measures. Cardiac activity, including heart-rate variability metrics, stress hormones, and eye-tracking metrics were the most frequently and electroencephalography (EEG) was the least frequently used objective measures. Around 40% of selected papers collected at least two objective measures, 41% used wearable devices, 23% performed synchronization and annotation, and 76% conducted baseline or multi-point data acquisition. Furthermore, 93% used a variety of statistical techniques, 14% applied regression models, and only one study released a public, anonymized dataset. This review of data modalities, experimental setups, and analysis techniques for intraoperative stress monitoring highlights the initiatives of surgical data science and motivates research on computational techniques for mental and surgical skills assessment and cognition-guided surgery.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to make a systematic review of the manpower prediction model of the construction industry. It aims to determine the forecasting model's development trend, analyse the use limitations and applicable conditions of each forecasting model and then identify the impact indicators of the human resource forecasting model from an economic point of view. It is hoped that this study will provide insights into the selection of forecasting models for governments and groups that are dealing with human resource forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: The common search engine, Scopus, was used to retrieve construction manpower forecast-related articles for this review. Keywords such as “construction”, “building”, “labour”, “manpower” were searched. Papers that not related to the manpower prediction model of the construction industry were excluded. A total of 27 articles were obtained and rated according to the publication time, author and organisation of the article. The prediction model used in the selected paper was analysed. Findings: The number of papers focussing on the prediction of manpower in the construction industry is on the rise. Hong Kong is the region with the largest number of published papers. Different methods have different requirements for the quality of historical data. Most forecasting methods are not suitable for sudden changes in the labour market. This paper also finds that the construction output is the economic indicator with the most significant influence on the forecasting model. Research limitations/implications: The research results discuss the problem that the prediction results are not accurate due to the sudden change of data in the current prediction model. Besides, the study results take stock of the published literature and can provide an overall understanding of the forecasting methods of human resources in the construction industry. Practical implications: Through this study, decision-makers can choose a reasonable prediction model according to their situation. Decision-makers can make clear plans for future construction projects specifically when there are changes in the labour market caused by emergencies. Also, this study can help decision-makers understand the current research trend of human resources forecasting models. Originality/value: Although the human resource prediction model's effectiveness in the construction industry is affected by the dynamic change of data, the research results show that it is expected to solve the problem using artificial intelligence. No one has researched this area, and it is expected to become the focus of research in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract={Highlights: We reviewed soft-computing and statistical learning methods for predicting type 2 diabetes mellitus. We searched for papers published between 2010 and 2021 on three academic search engines, obtaining 34 relevant documents for the final meta-analysis. We analyzed the data extracted, compared the results and models, discussed their performance, and highlighted the issues related to T2DM. Finally, the decision trees model has the best prediction performances, with excellent accuracy compared to other soft-computing models in this systematic meta-analysis. Soft-computing and statistical learning models have gained substantial momentum in predicting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) disease. This paper reviews recent soft-computing and statistical learning models in T2DM using a meta-analysis approach. We searched for papers using soft-computing and statistical learning models focused on T2DM published between 2010 and 2021 on three different search engines. Of 1215 studies identified, 34 with 136952 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled algorithm’s performance was able to predict T2DM with an overall accuracy of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] of [0.82, 0.89]). The classification of diabetes prediction was significantly greater in models with a screening and diagnosis (pooled proportion [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.74, 0.97]) when compared to models with nephropathy (pooled proportion = 0.48 [0.76, 0.89] to 0.88 [0.83, 0.91]). For the prediction of T2DM, the decision trees (DT) models had a pooled accuracy of 0.88 [95% CI: 0.82, 0.92], and the neural network (NN) models had a pooled accuracy of 0.85 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.89]. Meta-regression did not provide any statistically significant findings for the heterogeneous accuracy in studies with different diabetes predictions, sample sizes, and impact factors. Additionally, ML models showed high accuracy for the prediction of T2DM. The predictive accuracy of ML algorithms in T2DM is promising, mainly through DT and NN models. However, there is heterogeneity among ML models. We compared the results and models and concluded that this evidence might help clinicians interpret data and implement optimum models for their dataset for T2DM prediction. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines suggest that clinical prediction algorithms can be used to screen patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without replacing polysomnography, the gold standard. Objective: We aimed to identify, gather, and analyze existing machine learning approaches that are being used for disease screening in adult patients with suspected OSA. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases to evaluate the validity of different machine learning techniques, with polysomnography as the gold standard outcome measure and used the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd) to assess risk of bias and applicability of each included study. Results: Our search retrieved 5479 articles, of which 63 (1.15%) articles were included. We found 23 studies performing diagnostic model development alone, 26 with added internal validation, and 14 applying the clinical prediction algorithm to an independent sample (although not all reporting the most common discrimination metrics, sensitivity or specificity). Logistic regression was applied in 35 studies, linear regression in 16, support vector machine in 9, neural networks in 8, decision trees in 6, and Bayesian networks in 4. Random forest, discriminant analysis, classification and regression tree, and nomogram were each performed in 2 studies, whereas Pearson correlation, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, artificial immune recognition system, genetic algorithm, supersparse linear integer models, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm were each performed in 1 study. The best area under the receiver operating curve was 0.98 (0.96-0.99) for age, waist circumference, Epworth Somnolence Scale score, and oxygen saturation as predictors in a logistic regression. Conclusions: Although high values were obtained, they still lacked external validation results in large cohorts and a standard OSA criteria definition. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Algorithmic decision-making increasingly shapes people's daily lives. Given that such autonomous systems can cause severe harm to individuals and social groups, fairness concerns have arisen. A human-centric approach demanded by scholars and policymakers requires considering people's fairness perceptions when designing and implementing algorithmic decision-making. We provide a comprehensive, systematic literature review synthesizing the existing empirical insights on perceptions of algorithmic fairness from 58 empirical studies spanning multiple domains and scientific disciplines. Through thorough coding, we systemize the current empirical literature along four dimensions: (1) algorithmic predictors, (2) human predictors, (3) comparative effects (human decision-making vs. algorithmic decision-making), and (4) consequences of algorithmic decision-making. While we identify much heterogeneity around the theoretical concepts and empirical measurements of algorithmic fairness, the insights come almost exclusively from Western-democratic contexts. By advocating for more interdisciplinary research adopting a society-in-the-loop framework, we hope our work will contribute to fairer and more responsible algorithmic decision-making. © The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract={Background: Conventionally, identifying isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation in gliomas is based on histopathological analysis of tissue specimens acquired via stereotactic biopsy or definitive resection. Accurate pre-treatment prediction of IDH mutation status using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can guide clinical decision-making. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning (DL) to determine IDH mutation status in gliomas. Methods: A systematic search of Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline, and Scopus was conducted to identify relevant publications until August 1, 2021. Articles were included if all the following criteria were met: (I) patients with histopathologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade II, III, or IV gliomas; (II) histopathological examination with the IDH mutation; (III) DL was used to predict the IDH mutation status; (IV) sufficient data for reconstruction of confusion matrices in terms of the diagnostic performance of the DL algorithms; and (V) original research articles. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) was used to assess the studies' quality. Bayes theorem was utilized to calculate the posttest probability. Results: Four studies with a total of 1,295 patients were included. In the training set, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were 93.9%, 90.9% and 0.958, respectively. In the validation set, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the SROC curve were 90.8%, 85.5% and 0.939, respectively. With a known pretest probability of 80.2%, the Bayes theorem yielded a posttest probability of 97.6% and 96.0% for a positive test and 27.0% and 30.6% for a negative test for training sets and validation sets, respectively. Discussion: This is the first meta-analysis that summarizes the diagnostic performance of DL in predicting IDH mutation status in gliomas via the Bayes theorem. DL algorithms demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance in predicting IDH mutation in gliomas. Radiomic features associated with IDH mutation, and its underlying pathophysiology extracted from advanced MRI may improve prediction probability. However, more studies are required to optimize and increase its reliability. Limitations include obtaining some data via email and lack of training and test sets statistics. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery. All rights reserved},

  abstract={Purpose of Review: To provide an overview of the literature regarding the use of machine learning algorithms to predict hypertension. A systematic review was performed to select recent articles on the subject. Recent Findings: The screening of the articles was conducted using a machine learning algorithm (ASReview). A total of 21 articles published between January 2018 and May 2021 were identified and compared according to variable selection, train-test split, data balancing, outcome definition, final algorithm, and performance metrics. Overall, the articles achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) between 0.766 and 1.00. The algorithms most frequently identified as having the best performance were support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest. Summary: Machine learning algorithms are a promising tool to improve preventive clinical decisions and targeted public health policies for hypertension. However, technical factors such as outcome definition, availability of the final code, predictive performance, explainability, and data leakage need to be consistently and critically evaluated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We used strict inclusion criteria to select relevant studies that have investigated the role of LA on feedback practices. To identify common features of LA for feedback studies, we coded relevant publications using an analytical framework that identifies four key dimensions of LA systems: what (types of data), how (analytic methods), why (objectives), and how educators and students are served by LA (stakeholders). Based on findings, we propose a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of LA for feedback systems and also suggest future empirical research in this area. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Learning analytics (LA) is a growing research trend and has recently been used in research and practices in massive open online courses (MOOCs). This systematic review of 166 articles from 2011–2021 synthesizes the trends and critical issues of LA in MOOCs. The eight-step process proposed by Okoli and Schabram was used to guide this systematic review in analyzing publication outlets, research purposes and methods, stakeholders, and researchers’ geographic locations and subjects. The review showed that MOOC LA research is primarily published in top-tier journals, such as the Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, and Computers & Education, as well as conference proceedings. The review also revealed that LA in MOOCs was used more frequently for the purpose of research than for practice (i.e., learning and teaching). Approximately 60% of the reviewed studies adopted learners’ log data and achievement data as the primary data sources. Statistics, machine learning, content analysis, social network analysis, text analysis, and data visualization were the top six specific data analysis techniques used in the MOOC LA studies. Regarding collaboration, more than half of the reviewed studies involved interdisciplinary collaborations, and approximately one-third involved international collaborations. We suggested future studies on MOOC LA interventions to improve learning and teaching practices, and the active interdisciplinary collaboration to increase the rigor of the studies and the dissemination of the knowledge. More detailed discussion and implications for research and practice are presented. This research provides insights on future research and practices regarding LA use in MOOCs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in medicine to improve healthcare and advance health equity. The application of AI-based technologies in radiology is expected to improve diagnostic performance by increasing accuracy and simplifying personalized decision-making. While this technology has the potential to improve health services, many ethical and societal implications need to be carefully considered to avoid harmful consequences for individuals and groups, especially for the most vulnerable populations. Therefore, several questions are raised, including (1) what types of ethical issues are raised by the use of AI in medicine and biomedical research, and (2) how are these issues being tackled in radiology, especially in the case of breast cancer? To answer these questions, a systematic review of the academic literature was conducted. Searches were performed in five electronic databases to identify peer-reviewed articles published since 2017 on the topic of the ethics of AI in radiology. The review results show that the discourse has mainly addressed expectations and challenges associated with medical AI, and in particular bias and black box issues, and that various guiding principles have been suggested to ensure ethical AI. We found that several ethical and societal implications of AI use remain underexplored, and more attention needs to be paid to addressing potential discriminatory effects and injustices. We conclude with a critical reflection on these issues and the identified gaps in the discourse from a philosophical and STS perspective, underlining the need to integrate a social science perspective in AI developments in radiology in the future.

  abstract={Study objective: Machine learning models carry unique potential as decision-making aids and prediction tools for improving patient care. Traumatically injured patients provide a uniquely heterogeneous population with severe injuries that can be difficult to predict. Given the relative infancy of machine learning applications in medicine, this systematic review aimed to better understand the current state of machine learning development and implementation to help create a basis for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic review from inception to May 2021, using Embase, MEDLINE through Ovid, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and relevant gray literature, for uses of machine learning in predicting the outcomes of trauma patients. The screening and data extraction were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Results: Of the 14,694 identified articles screened, 67 were included for data extraction. Artificial neural networks comprised the most commonly used model, and mortality was the most prevalent outcome of interest. In terms of machine learning model development, there was a lack of studies that employed external validation, feature selection methods, and performed formal calibration testing. Significant heterogeneity in reporting was also observed between the machine learning models employed, patient populations, performance metrics, and features employed. Conclusion: This review highlights the heterogeneity in the development and reporting of machine learning models for the prediction of trauma outcomes. While these models present an area of opportunity as an ancillary to clinical decision-making, we recommend more standardization and rigorous guidelines for the development of future models. © 2022 American College of Emergency Physicians},

  abstract={Objectives: While the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies in medicine has been significant, their application to doctor-patient communication is limited. As communicating risk is a challenging, yet essential, component of shared decision-making (SDM) in surgery, this review aims to explore the current use of AI and VR in doctor-patient surgical risk communication. Methods: The search strategy was prepared by a medical librarian and run in 7 electronic databases. Articles were screened by a single reviewer. Included articles described the use of AI or VR applicable to surgical risk communication between patients, their families, and the surgical team. Results: From 4576 collected articles, 64 were included in this review. Identified applications included decision support tools (15, 23.4%), tailored patient information resources (13, 20.3%), treatment visualization tools (17, 26.6%) and communication training platforms (19, 29.7%). Overall, these technologies enhance risk communication and SDM, despite heterogeneity in evaluation methods. However, improvements in the usability and versatility of these interventions are needed. Conclusions: There is emerging literature regarding applications of AI and VR to facilitate doctor-patient surgical risk communication. Practice implications: AI and VR hold the potential to personalize doctor-patient surgical risk communication to individual patients and healthcare contexts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat; rapid and timely identification of AMR improves patient prognosis and reduces inappropriate antibiotic use. Methods: Relevant literature in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers prior to 28 September 2021 was searched. Any study that deployed machine learning (ML) or a risk score as a tool to predict AMR was included in the final review; there were 25 studies that employed the ML algorithm to predict AMR. Results: Extended spectrum β-lactamases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem resistance were the most common outcomes in studies with a specific resistance pattern. The most common algorithms in ML prediction were logistic regression (n = 14 studies), decision tree (n = 14) and random forest (n = 7). The area under the curve (AUC) range for ML prediction was 0.48–0.93. The pooled AUC for ML prediction was 0.82 (0.78–0.85). Compared with risk score, higher specificity [87% (82–91) vs. 37% (25–51)] was indicated for ML prediction, but not sensitivity [67% (62–72) vs. 73% (67–79)]. Conclusions: Machine learning might be a potential technology for AMR prediction; however, retrospective methodology for model development, nonstandard data processing and scarcity of validation in a randomised controlled trial or real-world study limit the application of these models in clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging in healthcare in various forms, including AI-based clinical decision support systems, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, big data analytics and AI-enhanced robotics. Given their potential impact on clinical processes and decision-making, AI-based health technologies (AIHT) are now seen to have a transformative effect on the nursing and medical professions, and on advanced nursing practice in particular. Aims: While nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly called upon to play a crucial role in improving the healthcare provided to the population, little is known about the nature, extent and outcomes of their involvement and experience with AIHT. This study's research objectives are twofold. First, it aims to characterize NPs' involvement and experience with AIHT in terms of the functional and clinical attributes of the AIHT-based systems and applications that have emerged in advanced nursing care settings, and of the clinical tasks of NPs targeted for support by these systems and applications. Second, it aims to characterize this involvement and experience with AIHT in terms of its expected impacts on the clinical activities and performance of NPs, and of its potential outcomes for NPs' patients and for the general population. Method: We thus contribute to advanced practice nursing research by carrying out an initial evaluation of the role played by NPs in the emergence of these technologies, by means of a systematic review of the literature. Findings: This review demonstrates that NPs, acting alone or in collaboration with physicians and other healthcare professionals, participate in the development and evaluation of various AI-based decision-making and predictive tools in primary, hospital and emergency care settings. This participation involves NPs as diagnostic and therapeutic experts whose clinical activities, decision-making and performance can be significantly impacted by their adoption and assimilation of AIHT. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) needs to be accepted and understood by physicians and medical students, but few have systematically assessed their attitudes. We investigated clinical AI acceptance among physicians and medical students around the world to provide implementation guidance. Materials and methods: We conducted a two-stage study, involving a foundational systematic review of physician and medical student acceptance of clinical AI. This enabled us to design a suitable web-based questionnaire which was then distributed among practitioners and trainees around the world. Results: Sixty studies were included in this systematic review, and 758 respondents from 39 countries completed the online questionnaire. Five (62.50%) of eight studies reported 65% or higher awareness regarding the application of clinical AI. Although, only 10–30% had actually used AI and 26 (74.28%) of 35 studies suggested there was a lack of AI knowledge. Our questionnaire uncovered 38% awareness rate and 20% utility rate of clinical AI, although 53% lacked basic knowledge of clinical AI. Forty-five studies mentioned attitudes toward clinical AI, and over 60% from 38 (84.44%) studies were positive about AI, although they were also concerned about the potential for unpredictable, incorrect results. Seventy-seven percent were optimistic about the prospect of clinical AI. The support rate for the statement that AI could replace physicians ranged from 6 to 78% across 40 studies which mentioned this topic. Five studies recommended that efforts should be made to increase collaboration. Our questionnaire showed 68% disagreed that AI would become a surrogate physician, but believed it should assist in clinical decision-making. Participants with different identities, experience and from different countries hold similar but subtly different attitudes. Conclusion: Most physicians and medical students appear aware of the increasing application of clinical AI, but lack practical experience and related knowledge. Overall, participants have positive but reserved attitudes about AI. In spite of the mixed opinions around clinical AI becoming a surrogate physician, there was a consensus that collaborations between the two should be strengthened. Further education should be conducted to alleviate anxieties associated with change and adopting new technologies. Copyright © 2022 Chen, Zhang, Cai, Seery, Gonzalez, Ali, Ren, Qiao, Xue and Jiang.},

  abstract={Medical education is changing at a fast pace. Students attend medical school with a high degree of technological literacy and a desire for a diverse educational experience. As a result, a growing number of medical schools are incorporating technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education tools into their curriculum. Gamified training platforms include educational games, mobile medical apps, and virtual patient scenarios. We provide a systematic review of what is meant by gamification in this era. Specific educational games, mobile apps, and virtual simulations that may be used for preclinical and clinical training have been discovered and classified. The available data were presented in terms of the recognized platforms for medical education's possible benefits. Virtual patient simulations have been shown to enhance learning results in general. Gamification could improve learning, engagement, and cooperation by allowing for real-world application. They may also help with promoting risk-free healthcare decision-making, remote learning, learning analytics, and quick feedback. We account for Preclinical training which included 5 electronic games and 4 mobile apps, while clinical training included 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools. There were additionally nine more gamified virtual environment training products that were not commercially accessible. Many of these studies have shown that utilizing gamified media in medical education may confer advantages.

  abstract={Objective: A common phase of early-stage oncological treatment is the surgical resection of cancerous tissue. The presence of cancer cells on the resection margin, referred to as positive margin, is correlated with the recurrence of cancer and may require re-operation, negatively impacting many facets of patient outcomes. There exists a significant gap in the surgeon's ability to intraoperatively delineate between tissues. Mass spectrometry methods have shown considerable promise as intraoperative tissue profiling tools that can assist with the complete resection of cancer. To do so, the vastness of the information collected through these modalities must be digested, relying on robust and efficient extraction of insights through data analysis pipelines.Methods: We review clinical mass spectrometry literature and prioritize intraoperatively applied modalities. We also survey the data analysis methods employed in these studies. Results: Our review outlines the advantages and shortcomings of mass spectrometry imaging and point-based tissue probing methods. For each modality, we identify statistical, linear transformation and machine learning techniques that demonstrate high performance in classifying cancerous tissues across several organ systems. A limited number of studies presented results captured intraoperatively. Conclusion: Through continued research of data centric techniques, like mass spectrometry, and the development of robust analysis approaches, intraoperative margin assessment is becoming feasible. Significance: By establishing the relatively short history of mass spectrometry techniques applied to surgical studies, we hope to inform future applications and aid in the selection of suitable data analysis frameworks for the development of intraoperative margin detection technologies.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, globally. Stroke and heart attacks account for more than 80% of cardiovascular disease-related deaths. To prevent patient mismanagement and potentially save lives, effective screening at an early stage is needed. Diagnosis is typically made using an electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, ECG recordings are often corrupted by different types of noise, degrading the quality of the recording and making diagnosis more difficult. This paper reviews research on automatic ECG quality assessment techniques used in studies published from 2012–2022. The CinC11 Dataset is most often used for training and testing algorithms. Only one study tested its algorithm on people in real-time, but it did not specify the demographic data of the subjects. Most of the reviewed papers evaluated the quality of the ECG recordings per single lead. The accuracy of the algorithms reviewed in this paper range from 85.75% to 97.15%. More clarity on the research methods used is needed to improve the quality of automatic ECG quality assessment techniques and implement them in a clinical setting. This paper discusses the possible shortcomings in current research and provides recommendations on how to advance the field of automatic ECG quality assessment. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Machine learning has helped a lot in the field of cancer research. For the detection and diagnosis of cancer various algorithms like artificial neural networks, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Bayesian Networks, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor etc. have been used. Today Machine learning techniques are widely used in distinguishing and characterizing diseases by means of X-ray and CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) images. Using these techniques, one is attempting to anticipate the probability of building up of cancer growth before the disease occur. In this paper, a review has been done on different approaches used to detect different type of cancer using various machine learning techniques.

  abstract={Background: Due to their ability to solve complex problems, deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming increasingly popular in medical applications. However, decision-making by such algorithms is essentially a black-box process that renders it difficult for physicians to judge whether the decisions are reliable. The use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is often suggested as a solution to this problem. We investigate how XAI is used for skin cancer detection: how is it used during the development of new DNNs? What kinds of visualisations are commonly used? Are there systematic evaluations of XAI with dermatologists or dermatopathologists? Methods: Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Explore, Science Direct and Scopus were searched for peer-reviewed studies published between January 2017 and October 2021 applying XAI to dermatological images: the search terms histopathological image, whole-slide image, clinical image, dermoscopic image, skin, dermatology, explainable, interpretable and XAI were used in various combinations. Only studies concerned with skin cancer were included. Results: 37 publications fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Most studies (19/37) simply applied existing XAI methods to their classifier to interpret its decision-making. Some studies (4/37) proposed new XAI methods or improved upon existing techniques. 14/37 studies addressed specific questions such as bias detection and impact of XAI on man-machine-interactions. However, only three of them evaluated the performance and confidence of humans using CAD systems with XAI. Conclusion: XAI is commonly applied during the development of DNNs for skin cancer detection. However, a systematic and rigorous evaluation of its usefulness in this scenario is lacking. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objectives: To summarise the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision algorithms to classify ear disease from otoscopy. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Using the PRISMA guidelines, nine online databases were searched for articles that used AI computer vision algorithms developed from various methods (convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and k-nearest neighbours) to classify otoscopic images. Diagnostic classes of interest: normal tympanic membrane, acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media (COM) with or without perforation, cholesteatoma and canal obstruction. Main outcome measures: Accuracy to correctly classify otoscopic images compared to otolaryngologists (ground truth). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Version 2 tool was used to assess the quality of methodology and risk of bias. Results: Thirty-nine articles were included. Algorithms achieved 90.7% (95%CI: 90.1–91.3%) accuracy to difference between normal or abnormal otoscopy images in 14 studies. The most common multiclassification algorithm (3 or more diagnostic classes) achieved 97.6% (95%CI: 97.3–97.9%) accuracy to differentiate between normal, AOM and OME in three studies. AI algorithms outperformed human assessors to classify otoscopy images achieving 93.4% (95%CI: 90.5–96.4%) versus 73.2% (95%CI: 67.9–78.5%) accuracy in three studies. Convolutional neural networks achieved the highest accuracy compared to other classification methods. Conclusion: AI can classify ear disease from otoscopy. A concerted effort is required to establish a comprehensive and reliable otoscopy database for algorithm training. An AI-supported otoscopy system may assist health care workers, trainees and primary care practitioners with less otology experience identify ear disease. © 2022 The Authors.

The necessity of sophisticated algorithms to investigate different NP hard problems encountered in sports analytics was established in the recent past. Meta-heuristics have been applied as a promising approach to such problems. We identified team selection, optimal lineups, sports equipment optimization, scheduling and ranking, performance analysis, predictions in sports, and player tracking as seven major categories where meta-heuristics were implemented in research in sports. Some of our findings include (a) genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization have been extensively used in the literature, (b) meta-heuristics have been widely applied in the sports of cricket and soccer, (c) the limitations and challenges of using meta-heuristics in sports. Through awareness and discussion on implementation of meta-heuristics, sports analytics research can be rich in the future.  © 2022 M.K.A. Ariyaratne et al., published by Sciendo.},

  abstract={Background: The presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) is considered an independent prognostic factor associated with early recurrence and poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after resection. Artificial intelligence (AI), mainly consisting of non-deep learning algorithms (NDLAs) and deep learning algorithms (DLAs), has been widely used for MVI prediction in medical imaging. Aim: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms for non-invasive, preoperative prediction of MVI based on imaging data. Methods: Original studies reporting AI algorithms for non-invasive, preoperative prediction of MVI based on quantitative imaging data were identified in the databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) scale. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were calculated using a random-effects model with 95% CIs. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were generated to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the deep learning and non-deep learning models. In the non-deep learning group, we further performed meta-regression and subgroup analyses to identify the source of heterogeneity. Results: Data from 16 included studies with 4,759 cases were available for meta-analysis. Four studies on deep learning models, 12 studies on non-deep learning models, and two studies compared the efficiency of the two types. For predictive performance of deep learning models, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and AUC values were 0.84 [0.75–0.90], 0.84 [0.77–0.89], 5.14 [3.53–7.48], 0.2 [0.12–0.31], and 0.90 [0.87–0.93]; and for non-deep learning models, they were 0.77 [0.71–0.82], 0.77 [0.73–0.80], 3.30 [2.83–3.84], 0.30 [0.24–0.38], and 0.82 [0.79–0.85], respectively. Subgroup analyses showed a significant difference between the single tumor subgroup and the multiple tumor subgroup in the pooled sensitivity, NLR, and AUC. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrates the high diagnostic accuracy of non-deep learning and deep learning methods for MVI status prediction and their promising potential for clinical decision-making. Deep learning models perform better than non-deep learning models in terms of the accuracy of MVI prediction, methodology, and cost-effectiveness.

  abstract={Decision-making complexity, in a distributed environment, is due to hard tasks that a system must resolve. This complexity makes researchers focus on looking for solutions to cope with distributed environment problems. Multiagent system (MAS) technology is one of several proposed solutions. This technology rose the challenge in decision-making applications. To date, no systematic review has been conducting, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to give an overview of a multiagent-based decision-making system in various areas of science or technology. In this study, we review of 58 studies published from 2007 to 2019. The aim of this article is a critical analysis of recent approaches. We try to survey their impact on practice and research. The analysis of the extracted studies is based on three selection criteria that are defined in the paper. All included studies have analyzed from four different points of view: 1) theoretical view; 2) technical view; 3) agent view; and 4) application view. Moreover, we adopt the SWOT analysis to evaluate studied approaches. Multiagent technology is actually in the process of evolution and enhancement with the appearance of new trends in artificial intelligence, such as neural network and deep learning. The results of this review show suggestions for further research and practice.  © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract={Learning analytics includes interventions that will support learning and improve learning environments. Despite the fact that learning analytics is a promising field of study, the lack of empirical evidence on the effects of learning analytics-based interventions has been widely addressed in recent years. In this context, insights validated by experimental studies may play a crucial role. Therefore, there is a need for a report describing the methodological aspects and effects of current experimental interventions based on learning analytics. This systematic review provides an in-depth examination of learning analytics research that reports experimental findings to evaluate learning analytics-based interventions. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 protocol provided the basis for the work of this systematic review. This review contained 52 papers that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that student-facing dashboards are the most common learning analytics-based intervention. Evidence from how user data is handled for interventions demonstrates that the most common method is the distillation of data for human judgment. This study confirms that a significant proportion of experimental studies employing learning analytics interventions have demonstrated significant effects on learning outcomes. The effectiveness of learning analytics-based interventions is also addressed in this review in terms of motivation, engagement, and system usage behaviors. The findings of this study will contribute to the literature in terms of describing the experimentally validated findings of learning analytics-based interventions in depth. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

  abstract={Purpose: An indication for surgical therapy includes balancing benefits against risk, which remains a key task in all surgical disciplines. Decisions are oftentimes based on clinical experience while guidelines lack evidence-based background. Various medical fields capitalized the application of machine learning (ML), and preliminary research suggests promising implications in surgeons’ workflow. Hence, we evaluated ML’s contemporary and possible future role in clinical decision-making (CDM) focusing on abdominal surgery. Methods: Using the PICO framework, relevant keywords and research questions were identified. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systemic search strategy in the PubMed database was conducted. Results were filtered by distinct criteria and selected articles were manually full text reviewed. Results: Literature review revealed 4,396 articles, of which 47 matched the search criteria. The mean number of patients included was 55,843. A total of eight distinct ML techniques were evaluated whereas AUROC was applied by most authors for comparing ML predictions vs. conventional CDM routines. Most authors (N = 30/47, 63.8%) stated ML’s superiority in the prediction of benefits and risks of surgery. The identification of highly relevant parameters to be integrated into algorithms allowing a more precise prognosis was emphasized as the main advantage of ML in CDM. Conclusions: A potential value of ML for surgical decision-making was demonstrated in several scientific articles. However, the low number of publications with only few collaborative studies between surgeons and computer scientists underpins the early phase of this highly promising field. Interdisciplinary research initiatives combining existing clinical datasets and emerging techniques of data processing may likely improve CDM in abdominal surgery in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes the existing literature-related to data science and 183 practitioners' considerations by employing a survey-based research method. By blending the findings of this research with a well-established process capability maturity model standard, International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 330xx, and following a methodological maturity development framework, a theoretically grounded model, entitled as the data science capability maturity model (DSCMM) was developed. Findings: It was found that organizations seek a capability/maturity model standard to evaluate and improve their current data science capabilities. To close this research gap, the DSCMM is developed. It consists of six capability maturity levels and twenty-seven processes categorized under five process areas: organization, strategy management, data analytics, data governance and technology management. Originality/value: This paper validates the need for a process capability maturity model for the data science domain and develops the DSCMM by integrating literature findings and practitioners' considerations into a well-accepted process capability maturity model standard to continuously assess and improve the maturity of data science capabilities of organizations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis scale was used to assess the quality of studies. Results: In total, 42 studies were selected. The best reported area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value was 1, whereas the worst was 0.74. K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, deep neural networks, and random forest were the machine learning models most frequently used for achieving the best performance. Conclusion: We found that machine learning can predict the occurrence of individual chronic diseases, progression, and their determinants and in many contexts. The findings are original and relevant to improve clinical decisions and the organization of health care facilities. © 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health},

  abstract={Heart disease is one of the significant challenges in today's world and one of the leading causes of many deaths worldwide. Recent advancement of machine learning (ML) application demonstrates that using electrocardiogram (ECG) and patients' data, detecting heart disease during the early stage is feasible. However, both ECG and patients' data are often imbalanced, which ultimately raises a challenge for the traditional ML to perform unbiasedly. Over the years, several data level and algorithm level solutions have been exposed by many researchers and practitioners. To provide a broader view of the existing literature, this study takes a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to uncover the challenges associated with imbalanced data in heart diseases predictions. Before that, we conducted a meta-analysis using 451 reference literature acquired from the reputed journals between 2012 and November 15, 2021. For in-depth analysis, 49 referenced literature has been considered and studied, taking into account the following factors: heart disease type, algorithms, applications, and solutions. Our SLR study revealed that the current approaches encounter various open problems/issues when dealing with imbalanced data, eventually hindering their practical applicability and functionality. In the diagnosis of heart disease, machine learning approaches help to improve data-driven decision-making. A metadata analysis of 451 articles and content analysis of 49 selected articles of heart disease diagnosis. Researchers primarily concentrated on enhancing the performance of the models while disregarding other issues such as the interpretability and explainability of Machine learning algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The application of learning analytics in an online learning environment is increasing among researchers in educational fields because it can assist in providing standard and measurable decision making about student success. In this regard, there is a need for the online learning society and practitioners to be informed about how learning analytics is applied in the online learning environment. Therefore, this systematic review article aims to offer the reader essential details regarding the practical usage of learning analytics techniques in online learning environments to improve the quality of teaching and learning practices. The focal point of this review is threefold: to ascertain the focus of learning analytics research in online learning environments and its significant results, to identify the types of student-related analytics data in online learning environments and the issues related to analytics data, and to inform about the extent of interventions that have been applied in the learning analytics context, if any. Four procedures suggested by PRISMA were applied when conducting a systematic review. A total of 34 articles were chosen according to the review selection guideline by searching through online databases, including ACM Digital Library, LearnTechLib, ERIC, International Forum of Educational Technology & Society, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Society for Learning Analytics Research, and SpringerLink. The search keywords used were learning analytics data and online learning, learning analytics data and learning analytics intervention. The results were analysed based on the three focuses mentioned earlier and were interpreted accordingly. It is found that the applied focus of learning analytics is more oriented towards monitoring/analysis and prediction/intervention, and the commonly used types of student-analytics data are learning behaviour data and learning level data. Additionally, the intervention is still in the process of being developed. Lastly, the directions for future studies and limitations are also provided so as to further develop this emerging research area, and the findings can be a good reference point for other researchers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 technologies have revolutionized how care is provided to patients and how operations in hospitals are conducted. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1 aims to ensure access to healthcare facilities and a reduction in the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live births. This paper investigates the state of the art in the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in maternal healthcare: how they are transforming methods of treatment, diagnosis and monitoring of pregnancy, and how they are reorganizing the management and organization of healthcare systems. A systematic literature review was carried out with 43 papers that met specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. It was found that most of the research focus is on the provision of solutions for low- to medium-income countries that are still lagging behind in reducing maternal and child mortality rates even though there has been an advancement in terms of Industry 4.0 technology use. The research was largely quantitative in nature with models and frameworks developed as opposed to prototypes. It mainly combined the Internet of things (IoT) with Cloud computing and Big data analytics (BDA). Artificial intelligence (AI) in maternal healthcare was similarly trending. Only one paper focused on the use of blockchain in facilitating health information exchange of maternal records. Recommendations for policy and a future research agenda are made.

  abstract={Objective As the storage of clinical data has transitioned into electronic formats, medical informatics has become increasingly relevant in providing diagnostic aid. The purpose of this review is to evaluate machine learning models that use text data for diagnosis and to assess the diversity of the included study populations. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review on three public databases. Two authors reviewed every abstract for inclusion. Articles were included if they used or developed machine learning algorithms to aid in diagnosis. Articles focusing on imaging informatics were excluded. Results From 2,260 identified papers, we included 78. Of the machine learning models used, neural networks were relied upon most frequently (44.9%). Studies had a median population of 661.5 patients, and diseases and disorders of 10 different body systems were studied. Of the 35.9% (N = 28) of papers that included race data, 57.1% (N = 16) of study populations were majority White, 14.3% were majority Asian, and 7.1% were majority Black. In 75% (N = 21) of papers, White was the largest racial group represented. Of the papers included, 43.6% (N = 34) included the sex ratio of the patient population. Discussion With the power to build robust algorithms supported by massive quantities of clinical data, machine learning is shaping the future of diagnostics. Limitations of the underlying data create potential biases, especially if patient demographics are unknown or not included in the training. Conclusion As the movement toward clinical reliance on machine learning accelerates, both recording demographic information and using diverse training sets should be emphasized. Extrapolating algorithms to demographics beyond the original study population leaves large gaps for potential biases. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Objectives: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used in clinical medicine including studies focused on Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) to inform to clinical decision making. We aimed to summarize ML choices in studies that used ML to predict CDI or CDI outcomes. Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv and arXiv from inception to March 18, 2021. We included fully published studies that used ML where CDI constituted the study population, exposure or outcome. Two reviewers independently identified studies and abstracted outcomes. We summarized study characteristics and approaches to CDI definition and ML-specific modelling. Results: Forty-three studies of prediction (n = 21), classification (n = 17) or inference (n = 5) were included. Approaches to defining CDI were labelling during a clinical study or chart review (n = 21), electronic phenotyping (n = 13) or not specified (n = 9). None of the studies using an electronic phenotype described phenotype validation. Almost all studies (n = 41, 95%) conducted supervised ML and the most common ML algorithms were penalized logistic regression (n = 20, 47%) and classification tree (n = 17, 40%). Approaches to feature selection and dimension reduction were heterogeneous. Metrics were evaluated in a held-out test set in 16 (37%) studies; only seven used a time-based split. In terms of reporting quality assessment, the most poorly reported items were data leakage prevention (n = 0, 0%), code availability (n = 8, 19%) and class imbalance management (n = 12, 43%). Conclusions: While many studies have used ML to investigate CDI or CDI outcomes, electronic phenotyping of CDI was uncommon and phenotype validation was not reported in any study. Methodological approaches were heterogeneous. Validating CDI electronic phenotypes, evaluating performances of CDI models during a silent trial and deploying a CDI classifier to guide clinical practice are important future goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: To determine what subspecialties have applied machine learning (ML) to predict clinically significant outcomes (CSOs) within orthopaedic surgery and to determine whether the performance of these models was acceptable through assessing discrimination and other ML metrics where reported. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were queried for articles that used ML to predict achievement of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS), or substantial clinical benefit (SCB) after orthopaedic surgical procedures. Data pertaining to demographic characteristics, subspecialty, specific ML algorithms, and algorithm performance were analyzed. Results: Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies developed novel algorithms, whereas one study externally validated an established algorithm. All studies used ML to predict MCID achievement, whereas 3 (16.7%) predicted SCB achievement and none predicted PASS achievement. Of the studies, 7 (38.9%) concerned outcomes after spine surgery; 6 (33.3%), after sports medicine surgery; 3 (16.7%), after total joint arthroplasty (TJA); and 2 (11.1%), after shoulder arthroplasty. No studies were found regarding trauma, hand, elbow, pediatric, or foot and ankle surgery. In spine surgery, concordance statistics (C-statistics) ranged from 0.65 to 0.92; in hip arthroscopy, 0.51 to 0.94; in TJA, 0.63 to 0.89; and in shoulder arthroplasty, 0.70 to 0.95. Most studies reported C-statistics at the upper end of these ranges, although populations were heterogeneous. Conclusions: Currently available ML algorithms can discriminate the propensity to achieve CSOs using the MCID after spine, TJA, sports medicine, and shoulder surgery with a fair to good performance as evidenced by C-statistics ranging from 0.6 to 0.95 in most analyses. Less evidence is available on the ability of ML to predict achievement of SCB, and no evidence is available for achievement of the PASS. Such algorithms may augment shared decision-making practices and allow clinicians to provide more appropriate patient expectations using individualized risk assessments. However, these studies remain limited by variable reporting of performance metrics, CSO quantification methods, and adherence to predictive modeling guidelines, as well as limited external validation.

  abstract={Background and Aim: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world, which leads to the death of more than 10 million people in the world every year. Its early diagnosis, management and proper treatment play an important role in reducing complications and mortality. One of the support tools in early diagnosis, treatment and management of this disease are Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), which are divided into two groups, rule-based and non-rule-based. Rule-based decision support systems are created based on clinical guidelines, while non-rule-based decision support systems use machine learning. In this research, the effects of decision support systems, rule-based and non-rule-based, on cancer diagnosis, treatment and management were measured. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted using a systematic review method, which was conducted by searching the Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE and PubMED databases until 12/31/2021. After removing duplicates and evaluating the characteristics of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies related to the goal were selected. The selection of articles was based on the title, abstract and full text The data collection tool was the data extraction form, which included year of study, type of study, system of body, organ of body, the service provided by the decision support system, type of decision support system, effect, effect index and the score of effect index. Narrative synthesis were used for data analysis. Results: Out of 768 articles, 16 articles related to the objectives of the study were identified. Studies were presented in two categories of clinical decision-support systems: Rule-based and non-Rule based. The effects evaluated in the clinical decision support systems were Rule-based, dose adjustment, symptoms, adherence to treatment guidelines, care time, smoking, need for chemotherapy and pain management, all of which except pain management were significant and positive. The effects evaluated were in the category of non-Rule based clinical decision support systems, diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, controlling neutropenia, all of which were significant and positive except controlling neutropenia. Conclusion: The results obtained for the effectiveness of both Rule-based and non-Rule-based decision support systems indicated different benefits of these two categories. Therefore, using their combination in the field of cancer can bring very useful results. © 2022, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Purpose: Radiomics, a method used to extract large amount of data, may be useful for discriminating malignant characteristics for lung cancer staging. We aimed to critically appraise the current use of radiomics in medical imaging for determining nodal involvement in lung cancer. Methods: The literature was searched using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science for observational studies between the databases’ inception and January 2020. All observational studies compared diagnostic tests for lung cancer in comparison to diagnostic tests with a radiomic adjunct. For each study, data were extracted for study characteristics, methodological quality, and accuracy. Discrepancies in screening and extraction were resolved by a third reviewer. Data were synthesized narratively. Results: 15 studies were included, 13 of which were full reports, while two were conference abstracts. Overall, 3164 patients were enrolled with a total of 3379 LNs recorded (69% malignancy). Point estimate sensitivities for algorithms ranged from 52 to 99%, while specificity for the algorithms ranged from 60 to 92%. Area under the curve c-statistics were only reported for algorithms and not the clinician. Point estimate c-statistics ranged from 0.64 to 0.94, suggesting that the algorithms possessed good discrimination potentials. Conclusion: The current level of evidence of radiomic analysis methods for staging lung cancer is inconclusive and possesses heterogeneity in study design. Prospective external validation of these algorithms and direct comparisons using cut-off thresholds is required to determine their true predictive capability prior to implementation in clinical practice.

  abstract={Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems have been developed to help medical professional in their decision making routines towards a more accurate diagnosis. These systems process medical exams such as Magnetic Resonance (MRI) in order to quantify meaningful features. These can be used with similarity-measuring techniques in a Content-Based Image Retrieval context, or inputted into a machine learning classifier in order to support early disease detection. For cardiac MRIs, single slice descriptors have been proposed in the two-dimensional domain, shape descriptors have been proposed in the three-dimensional domain, and previous reviews have mapped these two descriptor categories. Nonetheless, no systematic review on these descriptors have looked at full cardiac MRI images sets. We have reviewed the literature by searching for descriptors that consider the whole slice set (multi-slice) or frames (multi-frame) in cardiac MRI exams. We discuss descriptors and techniques, the datasets that were used, and the different evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight literature gaps and research opportunities. © 2022},

Results: We find important differences in the functions, utilities and limitations of DSAs according to the choice of data, variables, technology and social work context. Discussion: The reviewed literature indicates that social workers are rarely involved in developing DSAs. This seems to result in a limited innovation of DSAs that are capable of stimulating the reflection of social workers and thereby qualifying their decision-making process.

  abstract={The improved treatment of knee injuries critically relies on having an accurate and costeffective detection. In recent years, deep-learning-based approaches have monopolized knee injury detection in MRI studies. The aim of this paper is to present the findings of a systematic literature review of knee (anterior cruciate ligament, meniscus, and cartilage) injury detection papers using deep learning. The systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines on several databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Appropriate metrics were chosen to interpret the results. The prediction accuracy of the deep-learning models for the identification of knee injuries ranged from 72.5–100%. Deep learning has the potential to act at par with human-level performance in decision-making tasks related to the MRI-based diagnosis of knee injuries. The limitations of the present deep-learning approaches include data imbalance, model generalizability across different centers, verification bias, lack of related classification studies with more than two classes, and ground-truth subjectivity. There are several possible avenues of further exploration of deep learning for improving MRI-based knee injury diagnosis. Explainability and lightweightness of the deployed deep-learning systems are expected to become crucial enablers for their widespread use in clinical practice. © 2022 by the authors.

Material and methods: This review was based on the PRISMA guidelines and QUADAS 2 tool. A systematic search was performed of the literature on cases with endodontic treatments, comparing AI algorithms (test) versus conventional image assessments (control) for finding radiographic features. The search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and the Cochrane library. Inclusion criteria were studies on the use of AI and machine learning in endodontic treatments using dental X-rays. Results: The initial search retrieved 1131 papers, from which 24 were included. High heterogeneity of the materials left out a meta-analysis.The reported subcategories were periapical lesion, vertical root fractures, predicting root/canal morphology, locating minor apical foramen, tooth segmentation and endodontic retreatment prediction. Radiographic features assessed were mostly periapical lesions. The studies mostly considered the decision of 1–3 experts as the reference for training their models. Almost half of the included materials campared their trained neural network model with other methods. More than 58% of studies had some level of bias. Conclusions: AI-based models have shown effectiveness in finding radiographic features in different endodontic treatments. While the reported accuracy measurements seem promising, the papers mostly were biased methodologically. © 2022 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.},

The meaning of radiomics and texture analysis as predictive techniques are not already systematically assessed. The aim of this study is to assess the role of radiomics in PC. Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase systematic review was conducted to assess the role of radiomics in PC. The search strategy was ‘radiomics [All Fields] AND (“pancreas” [MeSH Terms] OR “pancreas” [All Fields] OR “pancreatic” [All Fields])’ and only original articles referred to PC in humans in the English language were considered. Results: A total of 123 studies and 183 studies were obtained using the mentioned search strategy on PubMed and Embase, respectively. After the complete selection process, a total of 56 papers were considered eligible for the analysis of the results. Radiomics methods were applied in PC for assessment technical feasibility and reproducibility aspects analysis, risk stratification, biologic or genomic status prediction and treatment response prediction. Discussion: Radiomics seems to be a promising approach to evaluate PC from diagnosis to treatment response prediction. Further and larger studies are required to confirm the role and allowed to include radiomics parameter in a comprehensive decision support system. © The Author(s), 2022.},

  abstract={Background: Traditional pain assessment methods have significant limitations due to the high variability in patient reported pain scores and perception of pain by different individuals. There is a need for generalized and automatic pain detection and recognition methods. In this paper, stateof-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods in this field are analyzed as well as pain management techniques. Objective: The objective of the study is to analyze the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML in the analysis and management of pain and to disseminate this knowledge prompting future utilization by medical professionals. Study Design: A narrative review of the literature focusing on the latest algorithms in AI and ML for pain assessment and management. Methods: Research studies were collected using a literature search on PubMed, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore between 2018 and 2020. Results: The results of our assessment resulted in the identification of 47 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Pain assessment was the most studied subject with 11 studies, followed by automated measurements with 10 studies, spinal diagnosis with 8 studies, facial expression with 7 studies, pain assessment in special settings evaluated in 5 studies, 4 studies described treatment algorithms, and 2 studies assessed neonatal pain. These studies varied from simple to highly complex methodology. The majority of the studies suffered from inclusion of a small number of patients and without replication of results. However, considering AI and ML are dynamic and emerging specialties, the results shown here are promising. Consequently, we have described all the available literature in summary formats with commentary. Among the various assessments, facial expression and spinal diagnosis and management appear to be ready for inclusion as we continue to progress. Limitations: This review is not a systematic review of ML and AI applications in pain research. This review only provides a general idea of the upcoming techniques but does not provide an authoritative evidence-based conclusive opinion of their clinical application and effectiveness. Conclusion: While a majority of the studies focused on classification tasks, very few studies have explored the diagnosis and management of pain. Usage of ML techniques as support tools for clinicians holds an immense potential in the field of pain management. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved.},

Growth in the artificial intelligence medical device (AIMD) field is expected in the coming years. Major countries are currently establishing systems and policies to gain a leading position in the medical artificial intelligence market. The Republic of Korea has initiated the Act on Nurturing the Medical Devices Industry and Supporting Innovative Medical Devices for the development of AIMDs and is implementing it preemptively. As a result, the country has achieved an effective strategy for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the number of AIMD approvals (85 approved as of September 2021), and the creation of a document pertaining to internationally harmonized guidelines on AIMD-related terms and definitions. However, in order to develop and activate more AIMD products, it is necessary to improve post-market management such as product change and quality control in addition to approval.

  abstract={Background: Prediction modelling can greatly assist the health-care professionals in the management of diseases, thus sparking interest in neonatal sepsis diagnosis. The main objective of the study was to provide a complete picture of performance of prediction models for early detection of neonatal sepsis. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL databases were searched and articles which used various prediction modelling measures for the early detection of neonatal sepsis were comprehended. Data extraction was carried out based on Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist. Extricate data consisted of objective, study design, patient characteristics, type of statistical model, predictors, outcome, sample size and location. Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was applied to gauge the risk of bias of the articles. Results: An aggregate of ten studies were included in the review among which eight studies had applied logistic regression to build a prediction model, while the remaining two had applied artificial intelligence. Potential predictors like neonatal fever, birth weight, foetal morbidity and gender, cervicovaginitis and maternal age were identified for the early detection of neonatal sepsis. Moreover, birth weight, endotracheal intubation, thyroid hypofunction and umbilical venous catheter were promising factors for predicting late-onset sepsis; while gestational age, intrapartum temperature and antibiotics treatment were utilised as budding prognosticators for early-onset sepsis detection. Conclusion: Prediction modelling approaches were able to recognise promising maternal, neonatal and laboratory predictors in the rapid detection of early and late neonatal sepsis and thus, can be considered as a novel way for clinician decision-making towards the disease diagnosis if not used alone, in the years to come. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose of Review: This paper discusses personalized risk assessment and screening, incorporating genetic and radiomic breast cancer risk information. The paper further explores opportunities to incorporate genomic information into traditional risk assessment tools, to improve the discriminatory accuracy of these tools, and integrate the information into clinical decision-making. Recent Findings: We summarize screening guidelines, strategies for identifying high risk women and discuss clinical validation studies of polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We describe the options for supplemental imaging. Both sensitivity and specificity are improving in this area, and testing is more available. Summary: Personalized screening and chemoprevention will only be possible with improved risk estimates (including breast density and PRS), meaningful, consistent shared-decision making conversations, and widespread availability of modalities for supplemental imaging. Future directions include earlier genetic testing and further validation of the PRS, particularly in non-European populations, a focus on breast density and texture in risk estimation and management and education efforts around risk communication. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained tremendous popularity for various imaging related tasks such as artificial image generation to support AI training. GANs are especially useful for medical imaging–related tasks where training datasets are usually limited in size and heavily imbalanced against the diseased class. We present a systematic review, following the PRISMA guidelines, of recent GAN architectures used for medical image analysis to help the readers in making an informed decision before employing GANs in developing medical image classification and segmentation models. We have extracted 54 papers that highlight the capabilities and application of GANs in medical imaging from January 2015 to August 2020 and inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Our results show four main architectures of GAN that are used for segmentation or classification in medical imaging. We provide a comprehensive overview of recent trends in the application of GANs in clinical diagnosis through medical image segmentation and classification and ultimately share experiences for task-based GAN implementations. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},

  abstract={Trust has emerged as a key factor in people's interactions with AI-infused systems. Yet, little is known about what models of trust have been used and for what systems: robots, virtual characters, smart vehicles, decision aids, or others. Moreover, there is yet no known standard approach to measuring trust in AI. This scoping review maps out the state of affairs on trust in human-AI interaction (HAII) from the perspectives of models, measures, and methods. Findings suggest that trust is an important and multi-faceted topic of study within HAII contexts. However, most work is under-theorized and under-reported, generally not using established trust models and missing details about methods, especially Wizard of Oz. We offer several targets for systematic review work as well as a research agenda for combining the strengths and addressing the weaknesses of the current literature. © 2022 ACM.},

  abstract={Due to the challenges facing healthcare data, such as volume, velocity, variety and authenticity, the healthcare industry must deploy sophisticated digital technologies to store, analyze and generate meaningful, actionable insights. Healthcare organizations can use Big Data Analytics (BDA) to analyze and classify data into useful information for decision making and performance improvement. However, implementing BDA to optimize healthcare performance can be a challenge for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we examine how BDA is implemented and what factors influence healthcare organizations' decisions. Based on a systematic review of 25 studies, we identified five major thematic competencies: organizational, technical, analytical, cognitive, and social. A comprehensive BDA competency model was developed using these thematic categories. Using this model, we will examine the impact of BDA on healthcare performance and decision making. To close the BDA competency gap and improve the quality and competitiveness of healthcare performance, research, and practice, this model is supported by empirical evidence.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This systematic review of learning analytics frameworks between 2011 and 2021 in three databases resulted in an initial corpus of 268 articles and conference proceeding papers based on the occurrence of "learning analytics"and "framework"in titles, keywords and abstracts. The final corpus of 46 frameworks were analysed using a coding scheme derived from purposefully selected learning analytics frameworks. The results found that learning analytics frameworks share a number of elements and characteristics such as source, development and application focus, a form of representation, data sources and types, focus and context. Less than half of the frameworks consider student data privacy and ethics. Finally, while design and process elements of these frameworks may be transferable and scalable to other contexts, users in different contexts will be best-placed to determine their transferability/scalability.  © 2022 ACM.},

  abstract={Research has shown the value of social collaboration and the benefits it brings to learners. In this study, we investigate the worth of Social Network Analysis (SNA) in translating students' interactions in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) into proxy indicators of achievement. Previous research has tested the correlation between SNA centrality measures and achievement. Some results indicate a positive association, while others do not. To synthesize research efforts, investigate which measures are of value, and how strong of an association exists, this article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies that included 33 cohorts and 16 centrality measures. Achievement was operationalized in most of the reviewed studies as final course or task grade. All studies reported that one or more centrality measures had a positive and significant correlation with, or a potential for predicting, achievement. Every centrality measure in the reviewed sample has shown a positive correlation with achievement in at least one study. In all the reviewed studies, degree centralities correlated with achievement in terms of final course grades or other achievement measure with the highest magnitude. Eigenvector-based centralities (Eigenvector, PageRank, hub, and authority values) were also positively correlated and mostly statistically significant in all the reviewed studies. These findings emphasize the robustness and reliability of degree- and eigenvector-based centrality measures in understanding students’ interactions in relation to achievement. In contrast, betweenness and closeness centralities have shown mixed or weak correlations with achievement. Taken together, our findings support the use of centrality measures as valid proxy indicators of academic achievement and their utility for monitoring interactions in collaborative learning settings. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={The application of in silico medicine is constantly growing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. These technologies allow us to support medical decisions and self-management and reduce, refine, and partially replace real studies of medical technologies. In silico medicine may challenge some key principles: transparency and fairness of data usage; data privacy and protection across platforms and systems; data availability and quality; data integration and interoperability; intellectual property; data sharing; equal accessibility for persons and populations. Several social, ethical, and legal issues may consequently arise from its adoption. In this work, we provide an overview of these issues along with some practical suggestions for their assessment from a health technology assessment perspective. We performed a narrative review with a search on MEDLINE/Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The following key aspects emerge as general reflections with an impact on the operational level: cultural resistance, level of expertise of users, degree of patient involvement, infrastructural requirements, risks for health, respect of several patients’ rights, potential discriminations for access and use of the technology, and intellectual property of innovations. Our analysis shows that several challenges still need to be debated to allow in silico medicine to express all its potential in healthcare processes. © 2022 by the authors.

Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques allow for the reduction of time and money spent in the development of new gene therapy products and techniques. In this paper, we survey the current progress of gene therapy treatments for several diseases and explore machine learning applications in gene therapy. We also discuss the ethical implications of gene therapy and the use of machine learning in precision medicine.

  abstract={This paper is focused on real-time visual analytics for home-based rehabilitation dedicated for brain stroke survivors. This research is at the intersection of three main domains: visual analytics for time-oriented data and dynamic visual analytics with specific focus on data analytics for rehabilitation systems. This study has emphasized the analysis of the most important research works in these domains. The studies included in this review are published between January 2008 and December 2020 that met eligibility criteria. From 243 papers retrieved from research including the Google Scholar database and manual research, 69 papers were finally included. This paper presents a classification of the reviewed research based on key features required by the visual analytics for real-time monitoring of patients. The findings suggested that real-time monitoring visual analytics for biodata captured during the rehabilitation sessions was not sufficiently addressed by previous research. To provide real-time monitoring visual analytics of biodata, the concept of a unified framework that combines the processing of batch and stream data in a distributed architecture is proposed. The system is currently under development; its validation will be carried out by an experimental study and the evaluation of the system performance. © 2022, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

AI-technology has been employed in a wide range of applications related to the diagnosis of oral diseases that have demonstrated phenomenal precision and accuracy in their performance. The aim of this systematic review is to report on the diagnostic accuracy and performance of AI-based models designed for detection, diagnosis, and prediction of dental caries (DC). Eminent elec-tronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, Saudi Digital Library) were searched for relevant articles that were published from January 2000 until February 2022. A total of 34 articles that met the selection criteria were critically analyzed based on QUADAS-2 guidelines. The certainty of the evidence of the included studies was assessed using the GRADE approach. AI has been widely applied for prediction of DC, for detection and diagnosis of DC and for classification of DC. These models have demonstrated excellent performance and can be used in clinical practice for enhancing the diagnostic performance, treatment quality and patient outcome and can also be applied to identify patients with a higher risk of developing DC. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: In recent decades, the application of machine learning technologies to medical imaging has opened up new perspectives in neuro-oncology, in the so-called radiomics field. Radiomics offer new insight into glioma, aiding in clinical decision-making and patients’ prognosis evaluation. Although meningiomas represent the most common primary CNS tumor and the majority of them are benign and slow-growing tumors, a minor part of them show a more aggressive behavior with an increased proliferation rate and a tendency to recur. Therefore, their treatment may represent a challenge. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed. We included selected articles (meta-analysis, review, retrospective study, and case–control study) concerning the application of radiomics method in the preoperative diagnostic and prognostic algorithm, and planning for intracranial meningiomas. We also analyzed the contribution of radiomics in differentiating meningiomas from other CNS tumors with similar radiological features. Results: In the first research stage, 273 papers were identified. After a careful screening according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 39 articles were included in this systematic review. Conclusions: Several preoperative features have been identified to increase preoperative intracranial meningioma assessment for guiding decision-making processes. The development of valid and reliable non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic modalities could have a significant clinical impact on meningioma treatment. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={Human Resources Analytics (HRA) is drawing more attention every year, and will be crucial to human resource development. However, the literature around the topic would appear to be more promotional than descriptive. With this in mind, we conducted a systematic literature review and content analysis with the following objectives: first, to address the current state of HRA and second, to propose a framework for the development of HRA as a sustainable practice. We analyzed 79 articles from research databases and found 34 empirical studies for subsequent content analysis. While the main results reflect the relative newness of the field of HRA, with the majority of the empirical articles focusing on financial aspects, they also reveal the growing importance given to ethics. Finally, we propose a framework for the development of sustainable HRA based on the triple bottom line and discuss the implications of our findings for researchers and practitioners. 2022 Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Madrid.},

  abstract={Prenatal diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease (CHD) has progressed substantially in the past few decades. Fetal echocardiography can accurately detect and diagnose approximately 85% of cardiac anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis of CHD results in improved care, with improved risk stratification, perioperative status and survival. However, there is much work to be done. A minority of CHD is actually identified prenatally. This seemingly incongruous gap is due, in part, to diminished recognition of an anomaly even when present in the images and the need for increased training to obtain specialized cardiac views. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field within computer science that focuses on the development of algorithms that “learn, reason, and self-correct” in a human-like fashion. When applied to fetal echocardiography, AI has the potential to improve image acquisition, image optimization, automated measurements, identification of outliers, classification of diagnoses, and prediction of outcomes. Adoption of AI in the field has been thus far limited by a paucity of data, limited resources to implement new technologies, and legal and ethical concerns. Despite these barriers, recognition of the potential benefits will push us to a future in which AI will become a routine part of clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Objective:Develop unifying definitions and paradigms for data-driven methods to augment postoperative resource intensity decisions.Summary Background Data:Postoperative level-of-care assignments and frequency of vital sign and laboratory measurements (ie, resource intensity) should align with patient acuity. Effective, data-driven decision-support platforms could improve value of care for millions of patients annually, but their development is hindered by the lack of salient definitions and paradigms.Methods:Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing patient acuity and resource intensity after inpatient surgery. Study quality was assessed using validated tools. Thirty-five studies were included and assimilated according to PRISMA guidelines.Results:Perioperative patient acuity is accurately represented by combinations of demographic, physiologic, and hospital-system variables as input features in models that capture complex, non-linear relationships. Intraoperative physiologic data enriche these representations. Triaging high-acuity patients to low-intensity care is associated with increased risk for mortality; triaging low-acuity patients to intensive care units (ICUs) has low value and imparts harm when other, valid requests for ICU admission are denied due to resource limitations, increasing their risk for unrecognized decompensation and failure-to-rescue. Providing high-intensity care for low-acuity patients may also confer harm through unnecessary testing and subsequent treatment of incidental findings, but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate this hypothesis. Compared with data-driven models, clinicians exhibit volatile performance in predicting complications and making postoperative resource intensity decisions.Conclusion:To optimize value, postoperative resource intensity decisions should align with precise, data-driven patient acuity assessments augmented by models that accurately represent complex, non-linear relationships among risk factors. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract={Lung cancer's radiomic phenotype may potentially inform clinical decision-making with respect to radical radiotherapy. At present there are no validated biomarkers available for the individualisation of radical radiotherapy in lung cancer and the mortality rate of this disease remains the highest of all other solid tumours. MEDLINE was searched using the terms ‘radiomics’ and ‘lung cancer’ according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Met-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Radiomics studies were defined as those manuscripts describing the extraction and analysis of at least 10 quantifiable imaging features. Only those studies assessing disease control, survival or toxicity outcomes for patients with lung cancer following radical radiotherapy ± chemotherapy were included. Study titles and abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers. The Radiomics Quality Score was applied to the full text of included papers. Of 244 returned results, 44 studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. End points frequently reported were local (17%), regional (17%) and distant control (31%), overall survival (79%) and pulmonary toxicity (4%). Imaging features strongly associated with clinical outcomes include texture features belonging to the subclasses Gray level run length matrix, Gray level co-occurrence matrix and kurtosis. The median cohort size for model development was 100 (15–645); in the 11 studies with external validation in a separate independent population, the median cohort size was 84 (21–295). The median number of imaging features extracted was 184 (10–6538). The median Radiomics Quality Score was 11% (0–47). Patient-reported outcomes were not incorporated within any studies identified. No studies externally validated a radiomics signature in a registered prospective study. Imaging-derived indices attained through radiomic analyses could equip thoracic oncologists with biomarkers for treatment response, patterns of failure, normal tissue toxicity and survival in lung cancer. Based on routine scans, their non-invasive nature and cost-effectiveness are major advantages over conventional pathological assessment. Improved tools are required for the appraisal of radiomics studies, as significant barriers to clinical implementation remain, such as standardisation of input scan data, quality of reporting and external validation of signatures in randomised, interventional clinical trials. © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists},

  abstract={Purpose: This review focuses on utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in analysis of biofluid markers in glaucoma. We detail the accuracy and validity of AI in the exploration of biomarkers to provide insight into glaucoma pathogenesis. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across five electronic databases including Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science. Studies pertaining to biofluid marker analysis using AI or bioinformatics in glaucoma were included. Identified studies were critically appraised and assessed for risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. Results: A total of 10,258 studies were screened and 39 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 23 cross-sectional studies (59%), nine prospective cohort studies (23%), six retrospective cohort studies (15%), and one case-control study (3%). Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) was the most commonly studied subtype (55% of included studies). Twenty-four studies examined disease characteristics, 10 explored treatment decisions, and 5 provided diagnostic clarification. While studies examined at entire metabolomic or proteomic profiles to determine changes in POAG, there was heterogeneity in the data with over 175 unique, differentially expressed biomarkers reported. Discriminant analysis and artificial neural network predictive models displayed strong differentiating ability between glaucoma patients and controls, although these tools were untested in a clinical context. Conclusion: The use of AI models could inform glaucoma diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. While insight into differentially expressed biomarkers is valuable in pathogenic exploration, no clear pathogenic mechanism in glaucoma has emerged. © The Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract={Purpose: Existing expert systems have not improved the diagnostic accuracy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this systematic literature review was to review and summarize state-of-the-art prediction models detecting or predicting VAP from exhaled breath, patient reports and demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: Both diagnostic and prognostic prediction models were searched from a representative list of multidisciplinary databases. An extensive list of validated search terms was added to the search to cover papers failing to mention predictive research in their title or abstract. Two authors independently selected studies, while three authors extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess both the risk of bias and the applicability of the prediction modelling studies. Technology readiness was also assessed. Results: Out of 2052 identified studies, 20 were included. Fourteen (70%) studies reported the predictive performance of diagnostic models to detect VAP from exhaled human breath with a high degree of sensitivity and a moderate specificity. In addition, the majority of them were validated on a realistic dataset. The rest of the studies reported the predictive performance of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models to detect VAP from unstructured narratives [2 (10%)] as well as baseline demographics and clinical characteristics [4 (20%)]. All studies, however, had either a high or unclear risk of bias without significant improvements in applicability. Conclusions: The development and deployment of prediction modelling studies are limited in VAP and related outcomes. More computational, translational, and clinical research is needed to bring these tools from the bench to the bedside.

  abstract={Ultrasound imaging of the lung has played an important role in managing patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During the COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been a popular diagnostic tool due to its unique imaging capability and logistical advantages over chest X-ray and CT. Pneumonia/ARDS is associated with the sonographic appearances of pleural line irregularities and B-line artefacts, which are caused by interstitial thickening and inflammation, and increase in number with severity. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, is increasingly used as a critical tool that assists clinicians in LUS image reading and COVID-19 decision making. We conducted a systematic review from academic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) and preprints on arXiv or TechRxiv of the state-of-the-art machine learning technologies for LUS images in COVID-19 diagnosis. Openly accessible LUS datasets are listed. Various machine learning architectures have been employed to evaluate LUS and showed high performance. This paper will summarize the current development of AI for COVID-19 management and the outlook for emerging trends of combining AI-based LUS with robotics, telehealth, and other techniques. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) models with MRI in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we compared the pathologic complete response (pCR) prediction performance of ML + radiomics with that of a deep learning (DL) algorithm. Methods: A search for relevant studies published until December 20, 2021 was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies −2 criteria. The I2 value assessed the heterogeneity of the included studies as well as the decision to adopt a random effects model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to quantify the predictive accuracy. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed to detect potential sources of study heterogeneity. A funnel plot was used to investigate publication bias. The PROSPERO ID of our study was CRD42022284071. Result: Seventeen eligible studies encompassing 3392 patients were evaluated in the analysis. ML + MRI showed high accuracy (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.84–0.91) in predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy. In subgroup analysis, the AUC of the DL subgroup (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88–0.97) was higher than that of the ML + radiomics subgroup (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.90) (P = 0.030). In the ML + radiomics subgroup, the studies using MRI combined with other parameters (clinical or histopathologic information; AUC = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85–0.96) reported better performance than studies using only MRI parameters (AUC = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.78–0.86) (P = 0.009). Conclusions: ML applied to MRI enabled moderate accuracy in predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed that DL had higher predictive accuracy than ML + radiomics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Significance: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. In the advent of medical digitization and telepathology, hyper/multispectral imaging (HMSI) allows for noninvasive, nonionizing tissue evaluation at a macroscopic level. Aim: We aim to summarize proposed frameworks and recent trends in HMSI-based classification and segmentation of gross-level skin tissue. Approach: A systematic review was performed, targeting HMSI-based systems for the classification and segmentation of skin lesions during gross pathology, including melanoma, pigmented lesions, and bruises. The review adhered to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For eligible reports published from 2010 to 2020, trends in HMSI acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis were identified. Results: HMSI-based frameworks for skin tissue classification and segmentation vary greatly. Most reports implemented simple image processing or machine learning, due to small training datasets. Methodologies were evaluated on heavily curated datasets, with the majority targeting melanoma detection. The choice of preprocessing scheme influenced the performance of the system. Some form of dimension reduction is commonly applied to avoid redundancies that are inherent in HMSI systems. Conclusions: To use HMSI for tumor margin detection in practice, the focus of system evaluation should shift toward the explainability and robustness of the decision-making process.  © The Authors.

  abstract={Lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and poses a severe threat to people’s health. Therefore, diagnosing lung nodules at an early stage is crucial to improving patient survival rates. Numerous computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to detect and classify such nodules in their early stages. Currently, CAD systems for pulmonary nodules comprise data acquisition, pre-processing, lung segmentation, nodule detection, falsepositive reduction, segmentation, and classification. A number of review articles have considered various components of such systems, but this review focuses on segmentation and classification parts. Specifically, categorizing segmentation parts based on lung nodule type and network architectures, i.e., general neural network and multiview convolution neural network (CNN) architecture. Moreover, this work organizes related literature for classification of parts based on nodule or non-nodule and benign or malignant. The essential CT lung datasets and evaluation metrics used in the detection and diagnosis of lung nodules have been systematically summarized as well. Thus, this review provides a baseline understanding of the topic for interested readers. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Purpose: The advent of clinically adapted machine learning algorithms can solve numerous problems ranging from disease diagnosis and prognosis to therapy recommendations. This systematic review examines the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluates the progress made to date towards their implementation in clinical practice. Methods: Systematic searching of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and WHO Covid-19 database) to identify original articles published between January 2011 and October 2021. Studies reporting ML techniques in clinical practice involving humans and ML algorithms with a performance metric were considered. Results: Of 873 unique articles identified, 36 studies were eligible for inclusion. The XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm showed the highest potential for clinical applications (n = 7 studies); this was followed jointly by random forest algorithm, logistic regression, and the support vector machine, respectively (n = 5 studies). Prediction of outcomes (n = 33), in particular Inflammatory diseases (n = 7) received the most attention followed by cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 5 for each) and Covid-19 (n = 4). Thirty-three out of the thirty-six included studies passed more than 50% of the selected quality assessment criteria in the TRIPOD checklist. In contrast, none of the studies could achieve an ideal overall bias rating of ‘low’ based on the PROBAST checklist. In contrast, only three studies showed evidence of the deployment of ML algorithm(s) in clinical practice. Conclusions: ML is potentially a reliable tool for clinical decision support. Although advocated widely in clinical practice, work is still in progress to validate clinically adapted ML algorithms. Improving quality standards, transparency, and interpretability of ML models will further lower the barriers to acceptability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infections occurring across all age groups. UTIs are a well-known cause of acute morbidity and chronic medical conditions. The current diagnostic methods of UTIs remain sub-optimal. The development of better diagnostic tools for UTIs is essential for improving treatment and reducing morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the science of computers where they have the ability to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The objective of this study was to analyze current views regarding attempts to apply artificial intelligence techniques in everyday practice, as well as find promising methods to diagnose urinary tract infections in the most efficient ways. We included six research works comparing various AI models to predict UTI. The literature examined here confirms the relevance of AI models in UTI diagnosis, while it has not yet been established which model is preferable for infection prediction in adult patients. AI models achieve a high performance in retrospective studies, but further studies are required. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Field hockey is an evolving sport, but it is unclear whether performance analysis techniques are reflective of current best practice. The objective of this review was to identify performance analysis methods used in field hockey, assess their practicality, and provide recommendations on their implementation in the field. A systematic search of the databases SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE and PubMed was performed. Key words addressed performance analysis methods and field hockey, with all other disciplines of sport science excluded. A total of 8 articles were identified from the systematic review. Three studies explored patterns of play in relation to goal scoring opportunities, two articles examined penalty corner strategies and three compared specific actions in hockey. The limited performance analysis research in field hockey has focused on game actions in patterns of play. However, greater insights may be gained by analysing hockey using a holistic approach that incorporates spatio-temporal variables and player-opposition interactions. There is an opportunity to employ novel performance analysis techniques in hockey which provide more practical and effective approaches for analysing strategies and tactics. © The Author(s) 2021.},

On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are known to “keep learning” as the data increase. In this context, our research question emerges: what AI-based methods, in the literature, could be used to automatize business processes and support the decision-making processes of companies? To fill this gap, in this paper, we performed a review of the literature to identify these techniques. We ensured the usage of methods since they allowed reproducibility and extensions. We applied our search string in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and discovered 21 relevant papers pertaining to our question. In these papers, we identified methods that automated tasks and helped analysts make assertive decisions when designing, extending, or reengineering business processes. The authors applied diverse AI techniques, such as K-means, Bayesian networks, and swarm intelligence.

  abstract={This study presents a systematic review on the methods used to acquire Oxygen uptake (VO2) and heart rate (HR) for monitoring cardiovascular fitness during daily activities. VO2 and HR play a significant role especially during daily activities such as walking, exercise, or housekeeping. Several studies have been undertaken in recent years to evaluate VO2 and HR in a variety of target populations, mainly in two divisions; Direct Measurements and Estimations. Direct measurements are considered as the gold standard for VO2 and HR measurements. However, despite its high level of accuracy, there are practical limitations associated with direct measurement systems. Direct measurements are expensive and sophisticated laboratory equipment is needed to measure VO2 and HR. On the other hand, estimations via wearable devices using mathematical equations or machine learning are more efficient and low-cost. Utilizing various sets of predictor variables and a variety of machine learning and statistical approaches, several types of measurement models have been formed, including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN), multilayer perceptron regressor (MLR) and Decision Tree Forest (DTF). Several studies proves that machine learning is the future direction for estimating VO2 and HR for monitoring cardiovascular fitness during daily activities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) augment decision-making processes and productivity by supporting surgeons over a range of clinical activities: from diagnosis and preoperative planning to intraoperative surgical assistance. We reviewed the literature to identify current AI platforms applied to neurosurgical perioperative and intraoperative settings and describe their role in multiple subspecialties. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to December 31st, 2020. Original articles were included if they: presented AI platforms implemented in perioperative, intraoperative settings and reported ML models’ performance metrics. Due to the heterogeneity in neurosurgical applications, a qualitative synthesis was deemed appropriate. The risk of bias and applicability of predicted outcomes were assessed using the PROBAST tool. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-one articles were included. All studies evaluated a supervised learning algorithm. A total of 10 ML models were described; the most frequent were neural networks (N.=15) and tree-based models (N.=13). Overall, the risk of bias was medium-high, but applicability was considered positive for all studies. Articles were grouped into four categories according to the subspecialty of interest: neurooncology, spine, functional and other. For each category, different prediction tasks were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarize the state-of-art applications of AI for the intraoperative augmentation of neurosurgical workflows across multiple subspecialties. ML models may boost surgical team performances by reducing human errors and providing patient-tailored surgical plans, but further and higher-quality studies need to be conducted. © 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

  abstract={Background and objective: Drug allergy alert systems (DAAS), have been considered an effective strategy to reduce preventable adverse drug events (ADEs), improving patient's safety. To date, no review has been conducted analyzing characteristics of DAAS in the hospital setting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify, describe and summarize the DAAS used in hospitals. The secondary objectives are to analyse drug allergy alerts (DAA) characteristics, the override rate (OvR) and the clinical consequences of alert overrides. Methods: Searches were conducted in Medline and Cochrane Library to identify studies describing DAAS. Systems characteristics, generated alerts, DAA, OvR, and its clinical consequences were extracted and analyzed. Results: Twenty-eight articles were included in the review. Seventeen different electronic DAAS were identified, of which 53% were commercially available. Systems differed in drug allergy information and rules for generating alerts. DAA were generally interruptive, triggered by non-exact match at drug prescribing and when ignored, an override reason was mandatory. The OvR ranged from 43.7% to 97%. The main override reason given by providers was that ‘patient had previously tolerated or had taken the drug without allergic reaction’. Clinical consequences of overriding DAA were only analyzed in four studies, with an ADE incidence between 0% and 6%. Conclusions: Different DAAS are used in hospitals with some degree of heterogeneity. Accurate and updated drug allergy information is important to generate only high value alerts. A regular review of DAAS and a standardization of alert rules, alert information and override reasons are necessary to optimize systems. Future studies should evaluate the impact of the DAAS aspects on preventing ADEs. © 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract={The last few years have witnessed an upsurge in the number of studies using Machine and Deep learning models to predict vital academic outcomes based on different kinds and sources of student-related data, with the goal of improving the learning process from all perspectives. This has led to the emergence of predictive modelling as a core practice in Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The aim of this study is to review the most recent research body related to Predictive Analytics in Higher Education. Articles published during the last decade between 2012 and 2022 were systematically reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. We identified the outcomes frequently predicted in the literature as well as the learning features employed in the prediction and investigated their relationship. We also deeply analyzed the process of predictive modelling, including data collection sources and types, data preprocessing methods, Machine Learning models and their categorization, and key performance metrics. Lastly, we discussed the relevant gaps in the current literature and the future research directions in this area. This study is expected to serve as a comprehensive and up-to-date reference for interested researchers intended to quickly grasp the current progress in the Predictive Learning Analytics field. The review results can also inform educational stakeholders and decision-makers about future prospects and potential opportunities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={(1) Background: The purpose of this review is to study the role of radiomics as a supporting tool in predicting bone disease status, differentiating benign from malignant bone lesions, and characterizing malignant bone lesions. (2) Methods: Two reviewers conducted the literature search independently. Thirteen articles on radiomics as a decision support tool for bone lesions were selected. The quality of the methodology was evaluated according to the radiomics quality score (RQS). (3) Results: All studies were published between 2018 and 2021 and were retrospective in design. Eleven (85%) studies were MRI‐based, and two (15%) were CT‐based. The sample size was <200 patients for all studies. There is significant heterogeneity in the literature, as evidenced by the relatively low RQS value (average score = 22.6%). There is not a homogeneous protocol used for MRI sequences among the different studies, although the highest predictive ability was always obtained in T2W‐FS. Six articles (46%) reported on the potential application of the model in a clinical setting with a decision curve analysis (DCA). (4) Conclusions: Despite the variability in the radiomics method application, the similarity of results and conclusions observed is encouraging. Substantial limits were found; prospective and multicentric studies are needed to affirm the role of radiomics as a supporting tool. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Purpose: We have utilized different methods in machine learning (ML) to develop the best algorithm to differentiate comorbid functional seizures (FS) and epilepsy from those who have pure FS. Methods: This was a retrospective study of an electronic database of patients with seizures. All patients with a diagnosis of FS (with or without comorbid epilepsy) were studied at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from 2008 until 2021. We arbitrarily selected 14 features that are important in making the diagnosis of patients with seizures and also are easily obtainable during history taking. Pytorch and Scikit-learn packages were used to construct various models including random forest classifier, decision tree classifier, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbor, and TabNet classifier. Results: Three hundred and two patients had FS (82.5%), while 64 patients had FS and comorbid epilepsy (17.5%). The “TabNet classifier” could provide the best sensitivity (90%) and specificity (74%) measures (accuracy of 76%) to help differentiate patients with FS from those with FS and comorbid epilepsy. Conclusion: These satisfactory differentiating measures suggest that the current algorithm could be used in clinical practice to help with the difficult task of distinguishing patients with FS from those with FS and comorbid epilepsy.

  abstract={Objectives: This systematic review aims to provide further insights into the conduct and reporting of clinical prediction model development and validation over time. We focus on assessing the reporting of information necessary to enable external validation by other investigators. Materials and Methods: We searched Embase, Medline, Web-of-Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar to identify studies that developed 1 or more multivariable prognostic prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data published in the period 2009-2019. Results: We identified 422 studies that developed a total of 579 clinical prediction models using EHR data. We observed a steep increase over the years in the number of developed models. The percentage of models externally validated in the same paper remained at around 10%. Throughout 2009-2019, for both the target population and the outcome definitions, code lists were provided for less than 20% of the models. For about half of the models that were developed using regression analysis, the final model was not completely presented. Discussion: Overall, we observed limited improvement over time in the conduct and reporting of clinical prediction model development and validation. In particular, the prediction problem definition was often not clearly reported, and the final model was often not completely presented. Conclusion: Improvement in the reporting of information necessary to enable external validation by other investigators is still urgently needed to increase clinical adoption of developed models.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

  abstract={Background: Although current efforts are made to diminish the incidence and burden of disease, cancer is still widely identified late at stage. This study aims to conduct a systematic review mapping the existent and emerging clinical research on artificial intelligence (AI) in the treatment of cancer and to underpin its integration challenges and opportunities in the European Union (EU) health sector. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) evaluating global clinical trials (CTs; published between 2010 and 2020 or forthcoming) was concluded. Additionally, a horizon scanning (HS) exercise focusing on emerging trends (published between 2017 and 2020) was conducted. Results: Forty-four CTs were identified and analyzed. Selected CTs were divided into three research areas: (i) potential of AI combined with imaging techniques, (ii) AI's applicability in robotic surgery interventions and (iii) AI's potential in clinical decision making. Twenty-one studies presented an interventional nature, nine papers were observational and 14 articles did not explicitly mention the type of study performed. The papers presented an increased heterogeneity in sample size, type of tumour, type of study and reporting of results. In addition, a shift in research is observed and only a small fraction of studies were completed in the EU. These findings could be further linked to the current socio-economic, political, scientific, technological and environmental state of the EU in regard to AI innovation. Conclusion: To overcome the challenges threatening the EU's integration of such technology in the healthcare field, new strategies taking into account the EU's socio-economic and political environment are deemed necessary. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

  abstract={Objective: A learning health care system (LHS) uses routinely collected data to continuously monitor and improve health care outcomes. Little is reported on the challenges and methods used to implement the analytics underpinning an LHS. Our aim was to systematically review the literature for reports of real-time clinical analytics implementation in digital hospitals and to use these findings to synthesize a conceptual framework for LHS implementation. Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical analytics derived from electronic health records in adult inpatient and emergency department settings between 2015 and 2021. Evidence was coded from the final study selection that related to (1) dashboard implementation challenges, (2) methods to overcome implementation challenges, and (3) dashboard assessment and impact. The evidences obtained, together with evidence extracted from relevant prior reviews, were mapped to an existing digital health transformation model to derive a conceptual framework for LHS analytics implementation. Results: A total of 238 candidate articles were reviewed and 14 met inclusion criteria. From the selected studies, we extracted 37 implementation challenges and 64 methods employed to overcome such challenges. We identified common approaches for evaluating the implementation of clinical dashboards. Six studies assessed clinical process outcomes and only four studies evaluated patient health outcomes. A conceptual framework for implementing the analytics of an LHS was developed. Conclusion: Health care organizations face diverse challenges when trying to implement real-time data analytics. These challenges have shifted over the past decade. While prior reviews identified fundamental information problems, such as data size and complexity, our review uncovered more postpilot challenges, such as supporting diverse users, workflows, and user-interface screens. Our review identified practical methods to overcome these challenges which have been incorporated into a conceptual framework. It is hoped this framework will support health care organizations deploying near-real-time clinical dashboards and progress toward an LHS.  © 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Purpose: This study examined the methodological quality of radiomics to predict the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We performed a meta-analysis of radiomics studies evaluating the bias risk and treatment response estimation. Methods: Our study was conducted through a literature review as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included radiomics-related papers, published prior to January 31, 2022, in our analysis to examine the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NPC. The methodological quality was assessed using the radiomics quality score. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was employed to evaluate inter-reader reproducibility. The pooled area under the curve (AUC), pooled sensitivity, and pooled specificity were used to assess the ability of radiomics to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NPC. Lastly, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies technique was used to analyze the bias risk. Results: A total of 12 studies were eligible for our systematic review, and 6 papers were included in our meta-analysis. The radiomics quality score was set from 7 to 21 (maximum score: 36). There was satisfactory ICC (ICC = 0.987, 95% CI: 0.957–0.996). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.91), respectively. The overall AUC was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88–0.93). Conclusion: Prediction response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in NPC using machine learning and radiomics is beneficial in improving standardization and methodological quality before applying it to clinical practice.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is used to predict and potentially prevent adverse patient outcomes. There is increasing interest in the application of these models in digital hospitals to improve clinical decision-making and chronic disease management, particularly for patients with diabetes. The potential of ML models using electronic medical records (EMR) to improve the clinical care of hospitalised patients with diabetes is currently unknown. Objective: The aim was to systematically identify and critically review the published literature examining the development and validation of ML models using EMR data for improving the care of hospitalised adult patients with diabetes. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Four databases were searched (Embase, PubMed, IEEE and Web of Science) for studies published between January 2010 to January 2022. The reference lists of the eligible articles were manually searched. Articles that examined adults and both developed and validated ML models using EMR data were included. Studies conducted in primary care and community care settings were excluded. Studies were independently screened and data was extracted using Covidence® systematic review software. For data extraction and critical appraisal, the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) was followed. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Quality of reporting was assessed by adherence to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guideline. The IJMEDI checklist was followed to assess quality of ML models and the reproducibility of their outcomes. The external validation methodology of the studies was appraised. Results: Of the 1317 studies screened, twelve met inclusion criteria. Eight studies developed ML models to predict disglycaemic episodes for hospitalized patients with diabetes, one study developed a ML model to predict total insulin dosage, two studies predicted risk of readmission, and one study improved the prediction of hospital readmission for inpatients with diabetes. All included studies were heterogeneous with regard to ML types, cohort, input predictors, sample size, performance and validation metrics and clinical outcomes. Two studies adhered to the TRIPOD guideline. The methodological reporting of all the studies was evaluated to be at high risk of bias. The quality of ML models in all studies was assessed as poor. Robust external validation was not performed on any of the studies. No models were implemented or evaluated in routine clinical care. Conclusions: This review identified a limited number of ML models which were developed to improve inpatient management of diabetes. No ML models were implemented in real hospital settings. Future research needs to enhance the development, reporting and validation steps to enable ML models for integration into routine clinical care. © 2022},

  abstract={The prediction of students' academic performance is an area of great concern for universities and educational institutions since academic performance is one of the most important aspects of the learning process. To analyze this behavior, this study makes a critical analysis of the topic of interest and aims to review, analyze and summarize the latest research advances related to the prediction of academic performance. The systematic literature review method is applied to answer three questions: (1) What factors are determinants in predicting students' academic performance? (2) what methods are used to predict students' academic performance? and (3) what are the objectives and interests in predicting students' academic performance? After conducting the study of 50 outstanding articles, as results, we found that academic factor is the guideline for predicting academic performance; supervised machine learning is the most used technique, highlighting support vector machine, random forests, and neural networks; the most outstanding objectives for the application of prediction were: Student performance with 53%, risk of failure with 14%, search for student knowledge with 12%, avoid dropout with 12%, and decision making with 10% © 2022 Percy De-La-Cruz, Rommel Rojas-Coaquira, Hugo Vega-Huerta, José Pérez-Quintanilla and Manuel Lagos-Barzola.This open-access article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 license},

  abstract={Introduction: Recent developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to healthcare promise to solve many of the existing global issues in advancing human health and managing global health challenges. This comprehensive review aims not only to surface the underlying ethical and legal but also social implications (ELSI) that have been overlooked in recent reviews while deserving equal attention in the development stage, and certainly ahead of implementation in healthcare. It is intended to guide various stakeholders (eg. designers, engineers, clinicians) in addressing the ELSI of AI at the design stage using the Ethics by Design (EbD) approach. Methods: The authors followed a systematised scoping methodology and searched the following databases: Pubmed, Web of science, Ovid, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO Search (Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, APA PsycArticles, ERIC) for the ELSI of AI in healthcare through January 2021. Data were charted and synthesised, and the authors conducted a descriptive and thematic analysis of the collected data. Results: After reviewing 1108 papers, 94 were included in the final analysis. Our results show a growing interest in the academic community for ELSI in the field of AI. The main issues of concern identified in our analysis fall into four main clusters of impact: AI algorithms, physicians, patients, and healthcare in general. The most prevalent issues are patient safety, algorithmic transparency, lack of proper regulation, liability & accountability, impact on patient-physician relationship and governance of AI empowered healthcare. Conclusions: The results of our review confirm the potential of AI to significantly improve patient care, but the drawbacks to its implementation relate to complex ELSI that have yet to be addressed. Most ELSI refer to the impact on and extension of the reciprocal and fiduciary patient-physician relationship. With the integration of AIbased decision making tools, a bilateral patient-physician relationship may shift into a trilateral one. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background: Optimal outcomes after large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke are highly dependent on prompt diagnosis, effective communication, and treatment, making LVO an attractive avenue for the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML). Our objective is to conduct a systematic review to describe existing AI applications for LVO strokes, delineate its effectiveness, and identify areas for future AI applications in stroke treatment and prognostication. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. After deduplication, studies were screened by title and abstract. Full-text studies were screened for final inclusion based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted from each study. Results: Of 11,512 resultant articles, 40 were included. Of 30 studies with reported ML algorithms, the most commonly used ML algorithms were convolutional neural networks in 10 (33.3%), support vector machines in 10 (33.0%), and random forests in 9 (30.0%). Studies examining triage favored direct transport to a stroke center and predicted improved outcomes. ML techniques proved vastly accurate in identifying LVO on computed tomography. Applications of AI to patient selection for thrombectomy are lacking, although some studies determine individual patient eligibility for endovascular treatment with high accuracy. ML algorithms have reasonable accuracy in predicting clinical and angiographic outcomes and associated factors. Conclusions: AI has shown promise in the diagnosis and triage of patients with acute stroke. However, the role of AI in the management and prognostication remains limited and warrants further research to help in decision support. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: As data science and artificial intelligence continue to rapidly gain traction, the publication of freely available ICU datasets has become invaluable to propel data-driven clinical research. In this guide for clinicians and researchers, we aim to: 1) systematically search and identify all publicly available adult clinical ICU datasets, 2) compare their characteristics, data quality, and richness and critically appraise their strengths and weaknesses, and 3) provide researchers with suggestions, which datasets are appropriate for answering their clinical question. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, ArXiv, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv. STUDY SELECTION: We selected all studies that reported on publicly available adult patient-level intensive care datasets. DATA EXTRACTION: A total of four publicly available, adult, critical care, patient-level databases were included (Amsterdam University Medical Center data base [AmsterdamUMCdb], eICU Collaborative Research Database eICU CRD], High time-resolution intensive care unit dataset [HiRID], and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV). Databases were compared using a priori defined categories, including demographics, patient characteristics, and data richness. The study protocol and search strategy were prospectively registered. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four ICU databases fulfilled all criteria for inclusion and were queried using SQL (PostgreSQL version 12; PostgreSQL Global Development Group) and analyzed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The number of unique patient admissions varied between 23,106 (AmsterdamUMCdb) and 200,859 (eICU-CRD). Frequency of laboratory values and vital signs was highest in HiRID, for example, 5.2 (±3.4) lactate values per day and 29.7 (±10.2) systolic blood pressure values per hour. Treatment intensity varied with vasopressor and ventilatory support in 69.0% and 83.0% of patients in AmsterdamUMCdb versus 12.0% and 21.0% in eICU-CRD, respectively. ICU mortality ranged from 5.5% in eICU-CRD to 9.9% in AmsterdamUMCdb. CONCLUSIONS: We identified four publicly available adult clinical ICU datasets. Sample size, severity of illness, treatment intensity, and frequency of reported parameters differ markedly between the databases. This should guide clinicians and researchers which databases to best answer their clinical questions. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The most critical step repeated at each process in risk management is "decision making." Decision trees, part of artificial intelligence, have been used in an integrated manner with different methods in decision-making under uncertainty in recent years. The main reason for this is the need to quantify uncertainty in project risk management and the need for a flexible decision-making process in project management. This article aims to determine which project risk management processes the appropriate methods are used more frequently and determine the literature gap. In this context, literature review and bibliometric analysis methods were used. The results indicate that the integrated use of related risk assessment methods has increased in the last five years. The methods were most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis, qualitative risk analysis, and risk identification processes. It has been determined that the number of studies conducted on risk monitoring and control processes is very few compared to the number of studies on other risk management processes. © 2022 International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century.

  abstract={The amount of information processed in the edu-cational component of the university is very important to be well managed through traditional methods. In addition, most of this information is on paper or on individual computers, which further complicates their processing. The smart university is a promising solution that will overcome most of the problems that slow down the development process of universities. This paper proposes a new pedagogy management system based on IoT tech-nology and the Hadoop framework to manage distributed data. The main objective is to respond to the limitations and challenges of existing systems and to provide an information system that helps its users to make intelligent decisions. Additionally, with the integration of the Hadoop cluster, the system provides better analysis times as the data grows.

  abstract={Low Back Pain (LBP) is currently the first cause of disability in the world, with a significant socioeconomic burden. Diagnosis and treatment of LBP often involve a multidisciplinary, individualized approach consisting of several outcome measures and imaging data along with emerging technologies. The increased amount of data generated in this process has led to the development of methods related to artificial intelligence (AI), and to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in particular, which aim to assist and improve the diagnosis and treatment of LBP. In this manuscript, we have systematically reviewed the available literature on the use of CAD in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic LBP. A systematic research of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases was performed. The search strategy was set as the combinations of the following keywords: “Artificial Intelligence”, “Machine Learning”, “Deep Learning”, “Neural Network”, “Computer Aided Diagnosis”, “Low Back Pain”, “Lumbar”, “Intervertebral Disc Degeneration”, “Spine Surgery”, etc. The search returned a total of 1536 articles. After duplication removal and evaluation of the abstracts, 1386 were excluded, whereas 93 papers were excluded after full-text examination, taking the number of eligible articles to 57. The main applications of CAD in LBP included classification and regression. Classification is used to identify or categorize a disease, whereas regression is used to produce a numerical output as a quantitative evaluation of some measure. The best performing systems were developed to diagnose degenerative changes of the spine from imaging data, with average accuracy rates >80%. However, notable outcomes were also reported for CAD tools executing different tasks including analysis of clinical, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and functional imaging data. Further studies are needed to better define the role of CAD in LBP care. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Purpose: According to the significant growth of literature and continued adoption of people analytics in practice, it has been promised that people analytics will inform evidence-based decision-making and improve business outcomes. However, existing people analytics literature remains underdeveloped in understanding whether and how such promises have been realized. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate the current reality of people analytics and uncover the debates and challenges that are emerging as a result of its adoption. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed articles focused on people analytics published in the Association of Business School (ABS) ranked journals between 2011 and 2021. Findings: The review illustrates and critically evaluates several emerging debates and issues faced by people analytics, including inconsistency among the concept and definition of people analytics, people analytics ownership, ethical and privacy concerns of using people analytics, missing evidence of people analytics impact and readiness to perform people analytics. Practical implications: This review presents a comprehensive research agenda demonstrating the need for collaboration between scholars and practitioners to successfully align the promise and the current reality of people analytics. Originality/value: This systematic review is distinct from existing reviews in three ways. First, this review synthesizes and critically evaluates the significant growth of peer-reviewed articles focused on people analytics published in ABS ranked journals between 2011 and 2021. Second, the study adopts a thematic analysis and coding process to identify the emerging themes in the existing people analytics literature, ensuring the comprehensiveness of the review. Third, this study focused and expanded upon the debates and issues evolving within the emerging field of people analytics and offers an updated agenda for the future of people analytics research. © 2021, Steven McCartney and Na Fu.},

Cardiology can benefit from Big Data, which are generated and released by different sources and channels, like epidemiological surveys, national registries, electronic clinical records, claims-based databases (epidemiological Big Data), wet-lab, and next-generation sequencing (molecular Big Data), smartphones, smartwatches, and other mobile devices, sensors and wearable technologies, imaging techniques (computational Big Data), non-conventional data streams such as social networks, and web queries (digital Big Data), among others. Big Data is increasingly having a more and more relevant role, being highly ubiquitous and pervasive in contemporary society and paving the way for new, unprecedented perspectives in biomedicine, including cardiology. Big Data can be a real paradigm shift that revolutionizes cardiological practice and clinical research.

  abstract={The purpose of this research is to know the current situation of strategic management in Higher Education Institutions, based on Data Analytics - Business Analytics, as a tool for new strategies in predictive models, since, just as companies now store massive data at Big Data level, where they focus on capturing and processing them, Higher Education Institutions do it in the same way, to make decisions. The strategic management in the Higher Education Institutions to be analyzed is based on the deployment model of the competitive strategy to be projected in the operation of the institutions, taking into account the axiomatic framework of strategic planning, a quality work culture and evidencing the results in key indicators. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature is carried out, called a secondary study and consists of five key steps: identification of questions for the review, identification of relevant works, evaluation of the quality of the studies, summary of the evidence, and finally, interpretation of the results. Additionally, one of the Ecuadorian Higher Education Institutions is shown as a case study. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Business students feel an urgency to be competent involving business intelligence in their studies and career. This study examines the current literature on business visual analytic technologies (VATs), both in the business community and in business learning, and points out consideration as a research gap in the existing literature. We conduct a systematic review with database searches from 2006 to 2020. The objectives of the review are to identify (a). the existing terminologies related to VATs in the literature; (b). the purpose of VAT application and the benefits of VATs in the business community; and to examine (c). how the VATs are related to the educational context, particularly, in business learning. The findings indicate that VATs provide positive enhancement in business analytics; however, the effect of VAT application in business learning is rather limited. We provide insights for further studies involving VAT-enhanced business learning.  © 2022 Yuyu Zhang et al.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) performs human intelligence-dependant tasks using tools such as Machine Learning, and its subtype Deep Learning. AI has incorporated itself in the field of cardiovascular medicine, and increasingly employed to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment, risk prediction, clinical care, and drug discovery. Heart failure has a high prevalence, and mortality rate following hospitalization being 10.4% at 30-days, 22% at 1-year, and 42.3% at 5-years. Early detection of heart failure is of vital importance in shaping the medical, and surgical interventions specific to HF patients. This has been accomplished with the advent of Neural Network (NN) model, the accuracy of which has proven to be 85%. AI can be of tremendous help in analyzing raw image data from cardiac imaging techniques (such as echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI amongst others) and electrocardiogram recordings through incorporation of an algorithm. The use of decision trees by Rough Sets (RS), and logistic regression (LR) methods utilized to construct decision-making model to diagnose congestive heart failure, and role of AI in early detection of future mortality and destabilization episodes has played a vital role in optimizing cardiovascular disease outcomes. The review highlights the major achievements of AI in recent years that has radically changed nearly all areas of HF prevention, diagnosis, and management. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract={Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied in nursing and midwifery to improve decision-making, patient care and service delivery. However, an understanding of the real-world applications of AI across all domains of both professions is limited. Objectives: To synthesise literature on AI in nursing and midwifery. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed and Scopus were searched using relevant terms. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened against eligibility criteria. Data were extracted, analysed, and findings were presented in a descriptive summary. The PRISMA checklist guided the review conduct and reporting. Results: One hundred and forty articles were included. Nurses’ and midwives' involvement in AI varied, with some taking an active role in testing, using or evaluating AI-based technologies; however, many studies did not include either profession. AI was mainly applied in clinical practice to direct patient care (n = 115, 82.14%), with fewer studies focusing on administration and management (n = 21, 15.00%), or education (n = 4, 2.85%). Benefits reported were primarily potential as most studies trained and tested AI algorithms. Only a handful (n = 8, 7.14%) reported actual benefits when AI techniques were applied in real-world settings. Risks and limitations included poor quality datasets that could introduce bias, the need for clinical interpretation of AI-based results, privacy and trust issues, and inadequate AI expertise among the professions. Conclusion: Digital health datasets should be put in place to support the testing, use, and evaluation of AI in nursing and midwifery. Curricula need to be developed to educate the professions about AI, so they can lead and participate in these digital initiatives in healthcare. Relevance for clinical practice: Adult, paediatric, mental health and learning disability nurses, along with midwives should have a more active role in rigorous, interdisciplinary research evaluating AI-based technologies in professional practice to determine their clinical efficacy as well as their ethical, legal and social implications in healthcare. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Medical big data are accumulated daily by medical staff in clinical settings. We developed a formulary in 2016 using medical big data from eight hospitals affiliated with Showa University, Japan (3200 beds). In 2019, we revised the procedure from the perspective of authenticity, reproducibility, and clarity to develop a medicine formulary with unbiased data. Briefly, we organized two teams of expert physicians. Team 1 was a systematic review team that conducted a literature search using systematic review. Team 2 was a medical big data team that conducted the analysis using medical big data. Both teams developed a bisphosphonate formulary. First and second team recommendations were alendronic acid and minodronic acid, and alendronic acid and risedronic acid, respectively. Discussion between the two teams yielded alendronic acid only in the bisphosphonate formulary. We developed reports for the bisphosphonate formulary that included conflicts of interest, the role of each staff member in developing the formulary, and the process for determining the formulary. To use our formulary in a community context, we updated the formulary on our website. We tried to substantiate our bisphosphonate formulary and make a recommendation to change the bisphosphonates according to our formulary. The formulary is focused on controlling the economic burden of medical expenses. We believe that the formulary needs to represent authenticity, reproducibility, and clarity in the procedure and conflicts of interest, with unbiased data to preclude context (hospital)-convenient decisions. © 2022 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan},

  abstract={We present a systematic literature review of data-driven self-regulated learning (SRL) that emphasises the methodological importance of temporality and sequence, as opposed to conventional statistical analysis. Researchers seem unanimous in their view of the importance of SRL in modern online and blended educational settings; this is borne out by number of reviews of literature on the subject. There has, as yet, been no systematic treatment of SRL in the context of its conceptualisation as a phenomenon that unfolds in sequences over time. To address this limitation, this review explores the corpus of work (n = 53) in which SRL and its related dimensions are analysed through the lenses of temporality, sequence and order. The results show that, in the pursuit of validity and impact, key decisions need to be addressed in regard to theoretical grounding, data collection, and analytic methods. Based on these outcomes, we propose a framework of directives and questions to aid researchers who want to push forward the field. This framework comprises four sub-areas: i) methodological considerations, relating to data capture and analytic processes; ii) theoretical considerations, relating to the usage of models of self-regulated learning and their related dimensions; iii) validity considerations, relating to the robustness of the chosen analytic outcomes studied; and iv) temporal considerations, relating to the articulation of analytic outcomes in the context of temporality and sequence. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Incessant application and new technological development to manage healthcare data significantly led to leveraging on the use of big data and analytics (BDA). The application of the capabilities from BDA has provided healthcare institutions with the ability to make critical and timely decisions for patients and data management. Adopting BDA by healthcare institutions hinges on some factors necessitating its application. This study aims to identify and review what influences healthcare institutions towards the use of business intelligence and analytics. With the use of a systematic review of 25 articles, the study identified nine dominant factors driving healthcare institutions to BDA adoption. Factors such as patient management, quality decision making, disease management, data management, and promoting healthcare efficiencies were among the highly ranked factors influencing BDA adoption. © 2022 by IGI Global.

  abstract={This systematic review explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the analysis of biofluid markers in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We detail the accuracy and validity of AI in diagnostic and prognostic models and biofluid markers that provide insight into AMD pathogenesis and progression. This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across 5 electronic databases including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Medline, and Web of Science from inception to July 14, 2021. Studies pertaining to biofluid marker analysis using AI or bioinformatics in AMD were included. Identified studies were assessed for risk of bias and critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. A total of 10,264 articles were retrieved from all databases and 37 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 15 cross-sectional studies, 15 prospective cohort studies, five retrospective cohort studies, one randomized controlled trial, and one case–control study. The majority of studies had a general focus on AMD (58%), while neovascular AMD (nAMD) was the focus in 11 studies (30%), and geographic atrophy (GA) was highlighted by three studies. Fifteen studies examined disease characteristics, 15 studied risk factors, and seven guided treatment decisions. Altered lipid metabolism (HDL-cholesterol, total serum triglycerides), inflammation (c-reactive protein), oxidative stress, and protein digestion were implicated in AMD development and progression. AI tools were able to both accurately differentiate controls and AMD patients with accuracies as high as 87% and predict responsiveness to anti-VEGF therapy in nAMD patients. Use of AI models such as discriminant analysis could inform prognostic and diagnostic decision-making in a clinical setting. The identified pathways provide opportunity for future studies of AMD development and could be valuable in the advance-ment of novel treatments. © 2022 Pucchio et al.},

  abstract={Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide educators and students with a comprehensive snapshot of the learning domain. Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties. While LADs have gained popularity, existing LADs are still far behind when it comes to employing predictive analytics into their designs. Our systematic literature review has revealed limitations in the utilization of predictive analytics tools among existing LADs. We find that studies leveraging predictive analytics only go as far as identifying the at-risk students and do not employ model interpretation or explainability capabilities. This limits the ability of LADs to offer data-driven prescriptive advice to students that can offer them guidance on appropriate learning adjustments. Further, published studies have mostly described LADs that are still at prototype stages; hence, robust evaluations of how LADs affect student outcomes have not yet been conducted. The evaluations until now are limited to LAD functionalities and usability rather than their effectiveness as a pedagogical treatment. We conclude by making recommendations for the design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project only relevant information. Finally, we stress the importance of developing dashboards that are ultimately evaluated for their effectiveness. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background and Aim: Proper triage of patients to receive medical services can manage their referral to medical centers, reduce mortality, and increase the quality of services provided. Due to the importance of this issue, some of the triage challenges were reviewed and described here. Methods: In the present systematic review study, to extract related studies, keywords Triage, Challenge, Pre-Hospital Emergency, and Hospital-Emergency were searched in both Persian and English in domestic and foreign databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct, SID, Magiran during 2011 to August 2021. Twenty articles were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. Results: Out of 6080 retrieved articles, 20 articles were reviewed. In the analysis, seven categories in the triage field challenges around the world were obtained, including 1- Incidence of miss triage and wastage of valuable emergency resources, 2- Insufficient knowledge about Existing types of triage algorithms, 3- Multiplicity of triage algorithms, creation of new algorithms and their unfamiliarity for health care personnel 4- Ethical problems for triage users 5- Lack of computer tools and artificial intelligence or their inefficiency 6- Distance between knowledge and practice of Healthcare personnel, and 7. Lack of codified simulated training courses. Conclusion: There are several challenges to performing triage in pre-hospital and hospital emergencies. Given the devastating effects of these challenges on patient service delivery, appropriate actions need to be taken by decision-makers to address them. © 2022 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

  abstract={Learning analytics are utilized to support learners' educational needs as well as to enhance their study success, for example, via the use of real-time prompts, motivational dashboards, and appropriate learning interventions, which have been shown to increase students' academic performance as well as their course retention rates. Yet, the perspective of higher education teachers in utilizing analytics to help analyze, reflect on, and improve their teaching design prior to delivery as well as to monitor and measure how the students engaged with their learning processes has been less recognized. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic review conducted from higher education teachers' perspective concerning how analytics can be deployed to adapt the curriculum to suit better students' educational needs in order to increase their study success. Thirty-five key studies were identified showing that analytics have been successful in influencing positively study success via teachers' academic curriculum intervention. Specifically, via analytics, higher education teachers could rapidly visualize common course pathways and identify any difficulties students experienced in real-time in order to increase their learning experiences and outcomes. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: Computerized migraine diagnostic tools have been developed and validated since 1960. We conducted a systematic review to summarize and critically appraise the quality of all published studies involving computerized migraine diagnostic tools. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, snowballing, and citation searching. Cutoff date for search was 1 June 2021. Published articles in English that evaluated a computerized/automated migraine diagnostic tool were included. The following summarized each study: publication year, digital tool name, development basis, sample size, sensitivity, specificity, reference diagnosis, strength, and limitations. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool was applied to evaluate the quality of included studies in terms of risk of bias and concern of applicability. Results: A total of 41 studies (median sample size: 288 participants, median age = 43 years; 77% women) were included. Most (60%) tools were developed based on International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria, half were self-administered, and 82% were evaluated using face-to-face interviews as reference diagnosis. Some of the automated algorithms and machine learning programs involved case-based reasoning, deep learning, classifier ensemble, ant-colony, artificial immune, random forest, white and black box combinations, and hybrid fuzzy expert systems. The median diagnostic accuracy was concordance = 89% [interquartile range (IQR) = 76–93%; range = 45–100%], sensitivity = 87% (IQR = 80–95%; range = 14–100%), and specificity = 90% (IQR = 77–96%; range = 65–100%). Lack of random patient sampling was observed in 95% of studies. Case–control designs were avoided in all studies. Most (76%) reference tests exhibited low risk of bias and low concern of applicability. Patient flow and timing showed low risk of bias in 83%. Conclusion: Different computerized and automated migraine diagnostic tools are available with varying accuracies. Random patient sampling, head-to-head comparison among tools, and generalizability to other headache diagnoses may improve their utility. © The Author(s), 2022.},

  abstract={Low-resource clinical settings are plagued by low physician-to-patient ratios and a shortage of high-quality medical expertise and infrastructure. Together, these phenomena lead to over-burdened healthcare systems that under-serve the needs of the community. Alleviating this burden can be undertaken by the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs); systems that support stakeholders (ranging from physicians to patients) within the clinical setting in their day-to-day activities. Such systems, which have proven to be effective in the developed world, remain to be under-explored in low-resource settings. This review attempts to summarize the research focused on clinical decision support systems that either target stakeholders within low-resource clinical settings or diseases commonly found in such environments. When categorizing our findings according to disease applications, we find that CDSSs are predominantly focused on dealing with bacterial infections and maternal care, do not leverage deep learning, and have not been evaluated prospectively. Together, these highlight the need for increased research in this domain in order to impact a diverse set of medical conditions and ultimately improve patient outcomes. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND Traditionally, dengue surveillance is based on case reporting to a central health agency. However, the delay between a case and its notification can limit the system responsiveness. Machine learning methods have been developed to reduce the reporting delays and to predict outbreaks, based on non-traditional and non-clinical data sources. The aim of this systematic review was to identify studies that used real-world data, Big Data and/or machine learning methods to monitor and predict dengue-related outcomes. Methodology/Principal findings We performed a search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and grey literature between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2020. The review (ID: CRD42020172472) focused on data-driven studies. Reviews, randomized control trials and descriptive studies were not included. Among the 119 studies included, 67% were published between 2016 and 2020, and 39% used at least one novel data stream. The aim of the included studies was to predict a dengue-related outcome (55%), assess the validity of data sources for dengue surveillance (23%), or both (22%). Most studies (60%) used a machine learning approach. Studies on dengue prediction compared different prediction models, or identified significant predictors among several covariates in a model. The most significant predictors were rainfall (43%), temperature (41%), and humidity (25%). The two models with the highest performances were Neural Networks and Decision Trees (52%), followed by Support Vector Machine (17%). We cannot rule out a selection bias in our study because of our two main limitations: we did not include preprints and could not obtain the opinion of other international experts. Conclusions/Significance Combining real-world data and Big Data with machine learning methods is a promising approach to improve dengue prediction and monitoring. Future studies should focus on how to better integrate all available data sources and methods to improve the response and dengue management by stakeholders. Author summary Dengue is one of the most important arbovirus infections in the world and its public health, societal and economic burden is increasing. Although the majority of dengue cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe disease forms can lead to death. For this reason, early diagnosis and monitoring of dengue are crucial to decrease mortality. However, most endemic regions still rely on traditional monitoring methods, despite the growing availability of novel data sources and data-driven methods based on real-world data, Big Data, and machine learning algorithms. In this systematic review, we identified and analyzed studies that used these novel approaches for dengue monitoring and/or prediction. We found that novel data streams, such as Internet search engines and social media platforms, and machine learning methods can be successfully used to improve dengue management, but are still vastly ignored in real life. These approaches should be combined with traditional methods to help stakeholders better prepare for each outbreak and improve early responsiveness. © 2022 Sylvestre et al.},

  abstract={Objectives: When diagnosing Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), radiologists cannot make an accurate judgments because the image characteristics of COVID-19 and other pneumonia are similar. As machine learning advances, artificial intelligence(AI) models show promise in diagnosing COVID-19 and other pneumonias. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy and methodological quality of the models. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase, preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv to locate studies published before December 2021, with no language restrictions. And a quality assessment (QUADAS-2), Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools and CLAIM checklist were used to assess the quality of each study. We used random-effects models to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity, I2 values to assess heterogeneity, and Deeks' test to assess publication bias. Results: We screened 32 studies from the 2001 retrieved articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We included 6737 participants in the test or validation group. The meta-analysis revealed that AI models based on chest imaging distinguishes COVID-19 from other pneumonias: pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.94–0.98), sensitivity 0.92 (95 % CI, 0.88–0.94), pooled specificity 0.91 (95 % CI, 0.87–0.93). The average RQS score of 13 studies using radiomics was 7.8, accounting for 22 % of the total score. The 19 studies using deep learning methods had an average CLAIM score of 20, slightly less than half (48.24 %) the ideal score of 42.00. Conclusions: The AI model for chest imaging could well diagnose COVID-19 and other pneumonias. However, it has not been implemented as a clinical decision-making tool. Future researchers should pay more attention to the quality of research methodology and further improve the generalizability of the developed predictive models. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Background: Keratoconus is a disorder characterized by progressive thinning and distortion of the cornea. If detected at an early stage, corneal collagen cross-linking can prevent disease progression and further visual loss. Although advanced forms are easily detected, reliable identification of subclinical disease can be problematic. Several different machine learning algorithms have been used to improve the detection of subclinical keratoconus based on the analysis of multiple types of clinical measures, such as corneal imaging, aberrometry, or biomechanical measurements. Objective: The aim of this study is to survey and critically evaluate the literature on the algorithmic detection of subclinical keratoconus and equivalent definitions. Methods: For this systematic review, we performed a structured search of the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2020. We included all full-text studies that have used algorithms for the detection of subclinical keratoconus and excluded studies that did not perform validation. This systematic review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations. Results: We compared the measured parameters and the design of the machine learning algorithms reported in 26 papers that met the inclusion criteria. All salient information required for detailed comparison, including diagnostic criteria, demographic data, sample size, acquisition system, validation details, parameter inputs, machine learning algorithm, and key results are reported in this study. Conclusions: Machine learning has the potential to improve the detection of subclinical keratoconus or early keratoconus in routine ophthalmic practice. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the corneal parameters that should be included for assessment and the optimal design for the machine learning algorithm. We have identified avenues for further research to improve early detection and stratification of patients for early treatment to prevent disease progression. © Howard Maile, Ji-Peng Olivia Li, Daniel Gore, Marcello Leucci, Padraig Mulholland, Scott Hau, Anita Szabo, Ismail Moghul, Konstantinos Balaskas, Kaoru Fujinami, Pirro Hysi, Alice Davidson, Petra Liskova, Alison Hardcastle, Stephen Tuft, Nikolas Pontikos.},

  abstract={Background: Asthma is a chronic disease that exacerbates due to various risk factors, including the patient’s biosignals and environmental conditions. It is affecting on average 7% of the world population. Preventing an asthma attack is the main challenge for asthma patients, which requires keeping track of any risk factor that can cause a seizure. Many researchers developed asthma attacks prediction models that used various asthma biosignals and environmental factors. These predictive models can help asthmatic patients predict asthma attacks in advance, and thus preventive measures can be taken. This paper introduces a review of these models to evaluate the used methods, model’s performance, and determine the need to improve research in this field. Method: A systematic review was conducted for the research articles introducing asthma attack prediction models for children and adults. We searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and IEEE databases from January 2000 to December 2020. The search includes the prediction models that used biosignal, environmental, and both risk factors. The research article’s quality was assessed and scored based on two checklists, the Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme clinical prediction rule checklist (CASP). The highest scored articles were selected to review. Result: From 1068 research articles we reviewed, we found that most of the studies used asthma biosignal factors only for prediction, few of the studies used environmental factors, and limited studies used both of these factors. Fifteen different asthma attack predictive models were selected for this review. we found that most of the studies used traditional prediction methods, like Support Vector Machine and regression. We have identified the pros and cons of the reviewed asthma attack prediction models and propose solutions to advance the studies in this field. Conclusion: Asthma attack predictive models become more significant when using both patient’s biosignal and environmental factors. There is a lack of utilizing advanced machine learning methods, like deep learning techniques.

  abstract={Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic disease that affects society, especially young people. In recent years, data sciences have been used extensively to deal with the disease. Machine learning is one of the main data sciences types which has been used to deal with chronic diseases such as MS. This study aimed to identify the applications of machine learning algorithms in MS disease. This study is a systematic review that conducted in 2020. The searches were done in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Sciences, Ovid, Science Direct, Embase, and Proquest scientific databases, by combining related keywords. Data extraction was done by using a data extraction form to follow the trends of this field of study. The results of the study showed that diagnosis of MS was the main application of machine learning in MS (33.3 %); also, assessment (24.24%) and prediction (18.18 %) of the disease were other main applications. The most used data type was medical images such as MRI and CT scans (55.17 %). The most used machine learning algorithm type was Support Vector Machine (SVM) (30 %) as a classification algorithm. The most optimized algorithm for the diagnosis and prediction of MS was KNN. It’s suggested to use machine learning algorithms to diagnose, assess, predict lesion classification, treatment, and severity determining of MS disease. Although the most common form of data used for MS is medical images, it is suggested that other types of data are generated to be used in machine learning algorithms. Considering the optimization rate of the algorithms used, it is suggested to pay more attention to the type of data and study objectives in data analysis using machine learning. © 2022 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

  abstract={Machine learning algorithms have been used for detection (and possibly) prediction of Alzheimer's disease using genotype information, with the potential to enhance the outcome prediction. However, detailed research about the analysis and the detection of Alzheimer's disease using genetic data is still in its primitive stage. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the scientific literature on the use of various machine learning approaches for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease based solely on genetic data. To identify gaps in the literature, critically appraise the reporting and methods of the algorithms, and provide the foundation for a wider research programme focused on developing novel machine learning based predictive algorithms in Alzheimer's disease. A systematic review of quantitative studies was conducted using three search engines (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus), and included studies between 1st of January 2010 and 31st December 2021. Keywords used were 'Alzheimer's disease(s)', 'GWAS, 'Artificial intelligence' and their synonyms. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 24 studies were included. Machine learning methods in the reviewed papers performed in a wide range ofways (0.59 to 0.98AUC). The main findings showed that high risk of bias in the analysis can be linked to feature selection, hyperparameter search and validation methods.  © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Background: A variety of emerging medical imaging technologies based on artificial intelligence have been widely applied in many diseases, but they are still limitedly used in the cerebrovascular field even though the diseases can lead to catastrophic consequences. Objective: This work aims to discuss the current challenges and future directions of artificial intelligence technology in cerebrovascular diseases through reviewing the existing literature related to applications in terms of computer-aided detection, prediction and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: Based on artificial intelligence applications in four representative cerebrovascular diseases including intracranial aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, arteriosclerosis and moyamoya disease, this paper systematically reviews studies published between 2006 and 2021 in five databases: National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier Science Direct, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science and Springer Link. And three refinement steps were further conducted after identifying relevant literature from these databases. Results: For the popular research topic, most of the included publications involved computer-aided detection and prediction of aneurysms, while studies about arteriovenous malformation, arteriosclerosis and moyamoya disease showed an upward trend in recent years. Both conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms were utilized in these publications, but machine learning techniques accounted for a larger proportion. Conclusion: Algorithms related to artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, are promising tools for medical imaging analysis and will enhance the performance of computer-aided detection, prediction and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, epistemic network analysis (ENA) has emerged as a quantitative ethnography tool for modeling discourse in different types of human behaviors. This article offers a comprehensive systematic review of ENA educational applications in empirical studies ({n}=76 ) published between 2010 and 2021. We review the ENA methods that research has relied on, the use of educational theories, their method of application, comparisons across groups and the main findings. Our results show that ENA has helped visually model the coded interactions and illustrate the connection strength among elements of network models. The applications of ENA have expanded beyond discourse analysis to several new areas of inquiry such as modeling surveys, log files or game play. Most of the reviewed articles used ENA based on educational theories and frameworks ({n}=53 , 69.7%), with one or more theories per article, while 23 articles (30.3%) did not report theoretical grounding. The implementation of ENA has enabled comparisons across groups and helped augment the insights of other methods such as process mining, however there is little evidence that studies have exploited the quantitative potential of ENA. Most of the reviewed studies used ENA on small sample size with manually coded interactions with few examples of large samples and automated coding.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Analysis of user-generated data (for example process data from logfiles, learning analytics, and data mining) in computer-based environments has gained much attention in the last decade and is considered a promising evolving field in learning sciences. In the area of educational assessment, the benefits of such data and how to exploit them are increasingly emphasised. Even though the use of process data in assessment holds significant promise, the ethical and regulatory implications associated with it have not been sufficiently considered. To address this issue and to provide an overview of how ethical and regulatory requirements interface with process data from assessments in primary and secondary education (K-12), we conducted a systematic literature review. Initial results showed that few studies considered ethical, privacy and regulatory issues in K-12 assessment, prompting a widening of the search criteria to include research in higher education also, which identified 22 studies. The literature that was relevant to our research questions represented an approximate balance in the number of theoretical and empirical studies. The studies identified as relevant interpret issues of privacy largely in terms of informed consent and the research pays little attention to ethical and privacy issues in the use of process data in assessment. The implications for the field of educational assessment and the use of process data are discussed. This includes the need to develop a specific code of ethics to govern the use of process- and logfile data in educational assessment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The main aims of precision medicine include early diagnosis, screening, and personalized treatment regime for a patient based on genetic-oriented features and characteristics. The main objective of this study was to review AI techniques and their effectiveness in neoplasm precision medicine. Materials and Methods. A comprehensive search was performed in Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, ISI Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception to December 29, 2021, in order to identify the studies that used AI methods for cancer precision medicine and evaluate outcomes of the models. Results. Sixty-three studies were included in this systematic review. The main AI approaches in 17 papers (26.9%) were linear and nonlinear categories (random forest or decision trees), and in 21 citations, rule-based systems and deep learning models were used. Notably, 62% of the articles were done in the United States and China. R package was the most frequent software, and breast and lung cancer were the most selected neoplasms in the papers. Out of 63 papers, in 34 articles, genomic data like gene expression, somatic mutation data, phenotype data, and proteomics with drug-response which is functional data was used as input in AI methods; in 16 papers' (25.3%) drug response, functional data was utilized in personalization of treatment. The maximum values of the assessment indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC) in included studies were 0.99, 1.00, 0.96, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.9929, respectively. Conclusion. The findings showed that in many cases, the use of artificial intelligence methods had effective application in personalized medicine. © 2022 Sorayya Rezayi et al.},

  abstract={Research background: With growing evidence of consumer adoption of mobile shopping apps, there is a pivotal need for comprehending Internet-enabled consumer devices in mobile shopping behavior. Mobile shopping platform features and user technological readiness configure consumers' expectations and demands as regards mobile retailing adoption, leading to acceptance of mobile shopping apps and payment services. Purpose of the article: In this research, prior findings have been cumulated indicating that mobile social apps extend throughout consumer attitudes and behaviors by the widespread adoption of smartphones. We contribute to the literature by showing that cutting-edge technological developments associated with customer behavior in relation to mobile commerce apps have resulted in the rise of data-driven systems. Consumer behavioral intention and adoption intention in relation to mobile shopping apps/websites are developed on perceived risk and trust consequences. Methods: Throughout February and March 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was carried out, with search terms comprising "mobile shopping app", "mobile commerce platform", "mobile payment service", "Internet-enabled consumer device", "consumer technological adoption", and "mobile shopping behavior". As research published between 2018 and 2021 was analyzed, only 330 sources met the suitability criteria. By removing questionable or indeterminate findings (insubstantial/inconsequent data), results unconfirmed by replication, too imprecise content, or having quite similar titles, 66, chiefly empirical, sources were selected. A systematic review of recently published literature was carried out on technological adoption of mobile commerce apps by employing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The Systematic Review Data Repository was used, a software program for the gathering, handling, and analysis of data for the systematic review. The quality of the academic articles was determined by harnessing the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Findings & value added: The consumer purchase decision-making process in mobile app-based marketing involves consumer engagement and willingness to adopt mobile commerce apps. Further advancements should clarify how technological-based consumer adoption of mobile shopping throughout social commerce can improve the payment for products and services. © 2021 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

  abstract={Early prediction of epilepsy seizures can warn the patients to take precautions and improve their lives significantly. In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly predominant in seizure prediction. However, existing deep learning-based approaches in this field require a great deal of labeled data to guarantee performance. At the same time, labeling EEG signals does require the expertise of an experienced pathologist and is incredibly time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a novel Consistency-based Semisupervised Seizure Prediction Model (CSSPM), where only a fraction of training data is labeled. Our method is based on the principle of consistency regularization, which underlines that a robust model should maintain consistent results for the same input under extra perturbations. Specifically, by using stochastic augmentation and dropout, we consider the entire neural network as a stochastic model and apply a consistency constraint to penalize the difference between the current prediction and previous predictions. In this way, unlabeled data could be fully utilized to improve the decision boundary and enhance prediction performance. Compared with existing studies requiring all training data to be labeled, the proposed method only needs a small portion of data to be labeled while still achieving satisfactory results. Our method provides a promising solution to alleviate the labeling cost for real-world applications.  © 2022 Deng Liang et al.},

  abstract={Background: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly fatal malignancy with a global overall 5-year survival of under 10%. Screening of PC is not recommended outside of clinical trials. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a very sensitive test to identify PC but lacks specificity and is operator-dependent, especially in the presence of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a growing field with a wide range of applications to augment the currently available modalities. This study was undertaken to study the effectiveness of AI with EUS in the diagnosis of PC. Methods: Studies from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases reporting the AI performance applied to EUS imaging for recognizing PC. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Results: A total of 11 articles reported the role of EUS in the diagnosis of PC. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI in recognizing PC were 80–97.5%, 83–100%, and 50–99%, respectively, with corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 75–99% and 57–100%, respectively. Types of AI studied were artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM). Seven studies using other than basic ANN reported a sensitivity and specificity of 88–96% and 83–94% to differentiate PC from CP. Two studies using SVM reported a 94–96% sensitivity, 93%–99% specificity, and 94–98% accuracy to diagnose PC from CP. The reported sensitivity and specificity of detection of malignant from benign Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) was 96% and 92%, respectively. Conclusion: AI reported a high sensitivity with high specificity and accuracy to diagnose PC, differentiate PC from CP, and differentiate benign from malignant IPMN when used with EUS. © The Author(s), 2022.},

  abstract={Importance: Diabetes is common amongst hospitalised patients and contributes to increased length of stay and poorer outcomes. Digital transformation, particularly the implementation of electronic medical records (EMRs), is rapidly occurring across the healthcare sector and provides an opportunity to improve the safety and quality of inpatient diabetes care. Alongside this revolution has been a considerable and ongoing evolution of digital interventions to optimise care of inpatients with diabetes including optimisation of EMRs, digital clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and solutions utilising data visibility to allow targeted patient review. Objective: To systematically appraise the recent literature to determine which digitally-enabled interventions including EMR, CDSS and data visibility solutions improve the safety and quality of non-critical care inpatient diabetes management. Methods: Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for suitable articles. Selected articles underwent quality assessment and analysis with results grouped by intervention type. Results: 1202 articles were identified with 42 meeting inclusion criteria. Four key interventions were identified; computerised physician order entry (n = 4), clinician decision support systems (n = 21), EMR driven active case finding (data visibility solutions) and targeted patient review (n = 10) and multicomponent system interventions (n = 7). Studies reported on glucometric outcomes, evidence-based medication ordering including medication errors, and patient and user outcomes. An improvement in glucometric measures particularly mean blood glucose and proportion of target range blood glucose levels and rates of evidence-based insulin prescribing were consistently demonstrated. Conclusion: Digitally-enabled interventions utilised to improve quality and safety of inpatient diabetes care were heterogenous in design. The majority of studies across all intervention types reported positive effects for evidence-based prescribing and glucometric outcomes. There was less evidence for digital interventions reducing diabetes medication administration errors or impacting patient outcomes (length of stay). © 2021},

  abstract={Corneal and ocular surface diseases (OSDs) carry significant psychosocial and economic burden worldwide. We set out to review the literature on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics for analysis of biofluid biomarkers in corneal and OSDs and evaluate their utility in clinical decision making. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science were systematically queried for articles using AI or bioinformatics methodology in corneal and OSDs and examining biofluids from inception to August 2021. In total, 10,264 articles were screened, and 23 articles consisting of 1058 individuals were included. Using various AI/bioinformatics tools, changes in certain tear film cytokines that are proinflammatory such as increased expression of apolipoprotein, haptoglobin, annexin 1, S100A8, S100A9, Glutathione S-transferase, and decreased expression of supportive tear film components such as lipocalin-1, prolactin inducible protein, lysozyme C, lactotransferrin, cystatin S, and mammaglobin-b, proline rich protein, were found to be correlated with pathogenesis and/or treatment outcomes of dry eye, keratoconus, meibomian gland dysfunction, and Sjögren’s. Overall, most AI/bioinformatics tools were used to classify biofluids into diseases subgroups, distinguish between OSD, identify risk factors, or make predictions about treatment response, and/or prognosis. To conclude, AI models such as artificial neural networks, hierarchical clustering, random forest, etc., in conjunction with proteomic or metabolomic profiling using bioinformatics tools such as Gene Ontology or Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were found to inform biomarker discovery, distinguish between OSDs, help define subgroups with OSDs and make predictions about treatment response in a clinical setting. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education has proven to be a useful learning technology; it can help learners achieve positive learning outcomes in the learning environment and can also enable teachers to better understand learners’ learning status and further improve their teaching strategies. This study reviewed the top 50 AI in higher education studies in the Web of Science database from the perspective of highly cited papers and based on a technology-based learning model. The results show that predictions of learners’ learning status (including dropout and retention, student models, and academic achievement) are most frequently discussed in the AI in higher education studies; AI technology is most commonly applied in engineering (including computer courses); AI technologies most often play the role of profiling and prediction in higher education, followed by intelligent tutoring systems and assessment and evaluation. In terms of research issues, the most frequently discussed issues are learning behaviour, accuracy, sensitivity and precision, cognition and affect. Learners’ higher order thinking skills, collaboration or communication, self-efficacy or confidence and skills are less frequently discussed in AI in higher education studies. Accordingly, we propose potential research issues and practitioner notes for AI in higher education as a reference for researchers, educators and decision-makers. Implications for practice or policy: • Higher education practitioners and researchers need to be aware of the latest developments in the research and practice of AI in higher education. • Teachers need to understand the role they can play in teaching and learning practices through AI technology and how to use it to assist learners. • It is important for administrators of educational institutions to understand the challenges teachers face in their teaching practices with AI technology and to develop measures to support them © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

A total of 49 papers were shortlisted and reviewed under different sections. The following general trends could be noted. Marketing analytics involves complex processes of analysing large volume of qualitative and quantitative data over a period of time to evaluate the success of marketing activities in terms of firm performance. Many successful firms have used this technique and this is one reason behind their improved performance. Many leading business organisations are using marketing analytics, the full potential is yet to be realised in spite of continuous arrival and further development of new software technologies and processes of marketing analytics. Especially, big data analytics offer more precise measurement and prediction of customer engagement and buying behaviour. At the same time, there are also challenges and barriers of top management support, lack of funds and resources, lack of enthusiasm, lack of skills and above all how to take decisions based on the results of marketing analytics. Addressing these challenges can improve the quality of marketing analytics systems and the ultimate results. This research has practical implications for firms which use marketing analytics systems. © 2022,International Journal for Quality Research. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract={Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical therapeutic procedure in blood diseases, and the investigation of HSCT data can provide valuable information. Machine learning (ML) techniques are useful data analysis tools which applied in many studies to predict HSCT survival and estimate the risk of transplantation. Areas covered: A systematic review was performed with a search of PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy publications for articles published by September 2020. Expert opinion: 24 papers that met eligibility criteria were included in this study.

  abstract={Background: In this modern era, depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders from which millions of individuals are affected today. The symptoms of depression are heterogeneous and often coincide with other disorders such as bipolar disorder, Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, etc. It is a serious mental illness that may lead to other health problems if left untreated. Currently, identifying individuals with depression is totally based on the expertise of the clinician’s experience. In order to assist clinicians in identifying the characteristics and classifying depressed people, different types of data modalities and machine learning techniques have been incorporated by researchers in this field. This study aims to find the answers to some important questions related to the trend of publications, data modality, machine learning models, dataset usage, pre-processing techniques and feature extraction and selection techniques that are prevalent and guide the direction of future research on depression diagnosis. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a broad range of articles from two major databases: IEEE Xplore and PubMed. Studies ranging from the years 2011 to April 2021 were retrieved from the databases resulting in a total of 590 articles (53 articles from the IEEE Xplore database and 537 articles from the PubMed database). Out of those, the articles which satisfied the defined inclusion criteria were investigated for further analysis. Results: A total of 135 articles were identified and analysed for this review. High growth in the number of publications has been observed in recent years. Furthermore, significant diversity in the use of data modalities and machine learning classifiers has also been noted in this study. fMRI data with an SVM classifier was found to be the most popular choice among researchers. In most of the studies, data scarcity and small sample size, particularly for neuroimaging data are major concerns. The use of identical data pre-processing tools for similar data modalities can be seen. This study also provides statistical analysis of the current framework with respect to the modality, machine learning classifier, sample size and accuracy by applying one-way ANOVA and the Tukey–Kramer test. Conclusion: The results indicate that an effective fusion of machine learning techniques with a potential data modality has a promising future for assisting clinicians in automatic depression diagnosis. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={In this paper, the information related to heart disease using IoT wearable devices is collected from any benchmark site, which is publicly available. With the collected data, feature extraction process is performed initially, in which heart rate, zero crossing rate, and higher order statistical features like standard deviation, median, skewness, kurtosis, variance, mean, peak amplitude, and entropy are extracted. For acquiring most significant features, the optimal feature selection process is implemented. As a novel contribution, the feature selection process is done by the hybrid optimization algorithm called PS-GWO by integrating GWO and PSO. Next, the extracted features are subjected to a famous deep learning algorithm named modified DBN, in which the activation function and number of hidden neurons is optimized using the same developed hybrid algorithm to improve the heart diagnosis accuracy. From the analysis, for the test case 1, the accuracy of the developed PS-GWO-DBN is 60%, 52.5%, 35% and 35% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN. For test case 2, the accuracy of the proposed PS-GWO-DBN is 26%, 24%, 21.6% and 17% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN, respectively. The accuracy of the designed PS-GWO-DBN is 26% advanced than NN, 24% advanced than KNN, 21.6% advanced than SVM and 17% advanced than DBN for test case 3. Thus, the proposed heart disease prediction model using PS-GWO-DBN performs better than other classifiers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={The use of computerized decision support systems (DSS) in nursing practice is increasing. However, research about who uses DSS, where are they implemented, and how they are linked with standards of nursing is limited. This paper presents evidence on users and settings of DSS implementation, along with specific nursing standards of practice that are facilitated by such DSS. We searched six bibliographic databases using relevant terms and identified 28 studies, each evaluating a unique DSS. Of these, 24 were used by registered nurses and 19 were implemented in short-term care units. Most of the DSS were found to facilitate nursing standards of assessment and intervention, however, outcome identification and evaluation were the least included standards.

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has enabled a major digital transformation in education, which has resulted in an enormous amount of educational data and has allowed us to acquire rich insights on each student. Simultaneously, the development witnessed by the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, and data analytics can provide new opportunities to improve the current state of education. However, will recent developments allow for a transformation from one size fits all to a more personal learning experience tailored to each student? Precision education is an emerging field that has been borrowed from the field of precision medicine. This research aims to provide a systematic review of the current literature on precision education in the context of EDM. The results indicate that the field of precision education that started in 2016 is still relatively young. Most research has focused on introducing intervention methods, and prediction is the most frequently-used task in mining data related to precision education. Taiwan is most interested in this field. Several challenges have been identified, and future research opportunities in this field have been highlighted, the most prominent of which provides immediate personal feedback. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={Controlling infectious diseases is a major health priority because they can spread and infect humans, thus evolving into epidemics or pandemics. Therefore, early detection of infectious diseases is a significant need, and many researchers have developed models to diagnose them in the early stages. This paper reviewed research articles for recent machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to infectious disease diagnosis. We searched the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, and IEEE databases from 2015 to 2022, identified the pros and cons of the reviewed ML models, and discussed the possible recommendations to advance the studies in this field. We found that most of the articles used small datasets, and few of them used real-time data. Our results demonstrated that a suitable ML technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the desired goal. Moreover, heterogeneous data could ensure the model's generalization, while big data, many features, and a hybrid model will increase the resulting performance. Furthermore, using other techniques such as deep learning and NLP to extract vast features from unstructured data is a powerful approach to enhancing the performance of ML diagnostic models.  © 2022 Eman Yahia Alqaissi et al.},

  abstract={This systematic review focuses on publications related to studies of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for collaborative learning. The use of AI for collaborative learning is a recent phenomenon and a systematic review of such studies is lacking. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, 41 journal articles were shortlisted. These articles were analysed in terms of the contexts of study (year, group size, platforms of interaction, and types of learners). Using a thematic approach, two broad foci and five sub-categories of use of AI for collaborative learning were identified: (1) learning outcomes – (a) collective performances, and (b) content of learning; (2) social interactions and processes – (c) sentiments and emotions, (d) discourse patterns and talk moves, and (e) learner characteristic and behaviours. The AI techniques were coded according to three broad purposes (discovering, learning and reasoning) and nine techniques: clustering, ensemble, regression algorithms, deep learning, decision trees, natural language processing, instance-based, fuzzy logic, and agents. A Sankey diagram was used to depict the relationships among the nine AI techniques to the five sub-categories of how AI was used to support collaborative learning. The gaps in the selected articles and limitations of the current review were discussed to suggest future areas of study. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Objective: Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonclinical dispositions that impact patient health risks and clinical outcomes. Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs. Materials and Methods: A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review. Results: Smoking status (n = 27), substance use (n = 21), homelessness (n = 20), and alcohol use (n = 15) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n = 7) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n = 13), substance use (n = 9), and alcohol use (n = 9). Conclusion: NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.},

Most of the studies were observational and majority of them were reported after 2010. Conclusions: There is a number of studies proved that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than conventional statistical method and even nephrologists. However, the soundness of AI/ML algorithms in PD still requires large databases and interpretation by clinical experts. In the future, we hope that AI will facilitate the management of PD patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival. © 2022 The Author(s).

The underlying CLL's genetic instability and changes in the host's health and comorbidities can all contribute to the acquisition of additional risk factors for adverse outcomes during the course of the disease. Therefore, available risk models solely based on pretreatment variables only partially predict patients' clinical outcome. A dynamic prognostic model that takes into account changes in the risk profile over time could indeed be useful in routine clinical practice. The next generation of risk assessment models should incorporate post-treatment and response biomarkers such as minimal residual disease. Finally, recent advances in the field of machine learning present novel opportunities to generate models capable of providing an individualized estimation of clinical outcomes in CLL. However, in the era of improved prognostic models, it is important to remember that these indices should supplement but not replace clinical expertise and medical decision-making. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Background: Significant efforts have been made to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for health care improvement. Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective: This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results: In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science. ©Fábio Gama, Daniel Tyskbo, Jens Nygren, James Barlow, Julie Reed, Petra Svedberg.},

  abstract={Introduction: To understand the current practices in stroke evaluation, the main clinical decision support system and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies need to be understood to assist the therapist in obtaining better insights about impairments and level of activity and participation in persons with stroke during rehabilitation. Methods: This scoping review maps the use of AI for the functional evaluation of persons with stroke; the context involves any setting of rehabilitation. Data were extracted from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PEDRO Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, AAAI Publications, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, and arXiv up to January 2021. The data obtained from the literature review were summarized in a single dataset in which each reference paper was considered as an instance, and the study characteristics were considered as attributes. The attributes used for the multiple correspondence analysis were publication year, study type, sample size, age, stroke phase, stroke type, functional status, AI type, and AI function. Results: Forty-four studies were included. The analysis showed that spasticity analysis based on ML techniques was used for the cases of stroke with moderate functional status. The techniques of deep learning and pressure sensors were used for gait analysis. Machine learning techniques and algorithms were used for upper limb and reaching analyses. The inertial measurement unit technique was applied in studies where the functional status was between mild and severe. The fuzzy logic technique was used for activity classifiers. Conclusion: The prevailing research themes demonstrated the growing utility of AI algorithms for stroke evaluation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract={Aim/Purpose This study carried out a systematic review of the literature on artificial intelli-gence (AI) in English language teaching (ELT). The objective was to delineate the current research progress in the field and to further understand the chal-lenges. Background The study analyzed articles published between 2015 and 2021. Methodology The qualitative research method was employed. Five steps were taken to steer the review. 200 articles were scrutinized; 64 were retained. Contribution Prior research on AI in ELT has not investigated how the literature is progress-ing or what areas of AI are being covered. Without a holistic picture, some im-portant research findings could be missed. Understanding how studies on AI in ELT are designed and implemented will contribute to a greater understanding of the existing state of research. Findings Findings show that there is a promising future for AI in ELT. AI in ELT yielded positive results in terms of optimizing the English language skills, translation, assessment, recognition, attitude, satisfaction, etc. It was also found out that more and more articles on the topic are being published; the mixed research method is the most commonly used, higher education level is the most sampled, students as participants are the most sampled, and most studies developed novel AI-based systems. Various AI approaches have been identified in the re-viewed studies, including machine learning, neural network, support vector ma-chine, genetic algorithms, deep learning, decision tree, expert system, natural language processing, data mining, cloud computing, and edge computing. How-ever, AI in ELT is still in its infancy, where little research has been conducted and gaps in the literature are still present, especially in terms of inherent issues related to body language, gestures, expressions, emotions, translation, lack of elaborate description of teaching material used for learning driven by AI, uncer-tainties and vagueness with regards to what can be considered under the realm of AI, and most authors being outside of the ELT discipline. Recommendations for Practitioners This literature review is likely to provide practitioners with an overview of the current adopted technology, research method, instruments and/or tools, educa-tional level, language skill, and the effects reported by the AI-based studies for designing effective systems for the use of AI in their ELT classrooms. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers need to conduct research on AI in ELT along with a detailed in-depth description of the methodology, research design, and the proposed sys-tems used to achieve AI in ELT. Furthermore, it is recommended that research-ers explore the efficiency of AI-based systems used in previous research and ensure their relevance and functionality. They are also required to provide in-depth analysis of the challenges inherent to systems that have been highlighted in the literature, which will maximize the potentials of these AI-based technolo-gies. Impact on Society The findings of this paper can provide visualization of research findings that could particularly benefit researchers, educators, and AI specialists who are in-volved in the study of the applications of AI in ELT. Future Research Future AI research needs to seriously include more detailed descriptions of the method in further research. © 2022. Journal of Information Technology Education: Research.

  abstract={Machine learning (ML), as a branch of artificial intelligence, acquires the potential and meaningful rules from the mass of data via diverse algorithms. Owing to all research of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belonging to the digitalization of clinical records or experimental works, a massive and complex amount of data has become an inextricable part of the related studies. It is thus not surprising that ML approaches, as novel and efficient tools to mine the useful knowledge from data, have created inroads in a diversity of scopes of TCM over the past decade of years. However, by browsing lots of literature, we find that not all of the ML approaches perform well in the same field. Upon further consideration, we infer that the specificity may inhere between the ML approaches and their applied fields. This systematic review focuses its attention on the four categories of ML approaches and their eight application scopes in TCM. According to the function, ML approaches are classified into four categories, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, and into 14 models as follows in more detail: support vector machine, least square-support vector machine, logistic regression, partial least squares regression, k-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis, artificial neural network, back propagation neural network, convolutional neural network, decision tree, random forest, principal component analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis. The eight common applied fields are divided into two parts: one for TCM, such as the diagnosis of diseases, the determination of syndromes, and the analysis of prescription, and the other for the related researches of Chinese herbal medicine, such as the quality control, the identification of geographic origins, the pharmacodynamic material basis, the medicinal properties, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, this paper discusses the function and feature difference among ML approaches when they are applied to the corresponding fields via comparing their principles. The specificity of each approach to its applied fields has also been affirmed, whereby laying a foundation for subsequent studies applying ML approaches to TCM.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract={Natural language processing (NLP), a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that models human language, has been used in medicine to automate diagnostics, detect adverse events, support decision making and predict clinical outcomes. However, applications to the clinical neurosciences appear to be limited. NLP has matured with the implementation of deep transformer models (e.g., XLNet, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa) and transfer learning. The objectives of this study were to (1) systematically review NLP applications in the clinical neurosciences, and (2) explore NLP analysis to facilitate literature synthesis, providing clear examples to demonstrate the potential capabilities of these technologies for a clinical audience. Our NLP analysis consisted of keyword identification, text summarization and document classification. A total of 48 articles met inclusion criteria. NLP has been applied in the clinical neurosciences to facilitate literature synthesis, data extraction, patient identification, automated clinical reporting and outcome prediction. The number of publications applying NLP has increased rapidly over the past five years. Document classifiers trained to differentiate included and excluded articles demonstrated moderate performance (XLNet AUC = 0.66, BERT AUC = 0.59, RoBERTa AUC = 0.62). The T5 transformer model generated acceptable abstract summaries. The application of NLP has the potential to enhance research and practice in the clinical neurosciences. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={The current study utilized a strategic search approach based on publishing trends, instructional, research methodological components, research emphasis, and adaptive techniques and technology, During the last one decade, several peer-reviewed articles have addressed to different dimensions of this domain area. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive and systematic narrative which can portray a review of studies and literature on this subject. This paper is an attempt to review the existing literature of recent times on adaptive learning technology in higher education. A total of 112 studies on adaptive learning were assessed to characterize the status and identify literature gaps. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was conducted using key databases to ensure the identification of all relevant articles. Documentation of many descriptive criteria, such as publishing trends, educational environment, and study technique components, was made available. The current study looked at the study focus, adaptive tactics, and adaptable technology. In some studies, the authors also looked at the design, development, implementation, and assessment processes. The authors used content and instructional models as well as adaptive sources to investigate adaptive approaches. The most widely investigated adaptive objectives were learner characteristics such as learning style and adaptive feedback and navigation. The findings of this study, which highlight research gaps for adaptive learning designers and researchers in the future, will be useful. To discover more about how adaptive learning might help people learn and advance, more study is needed. The lack of didactic literature on adaptive learning and the need to integrate domain expert knowledge emphasized the necessity of this research. This review adds to the body of theoretical reviews in the analytics literature of this domain. While prior theoretical reviews were restricted to methodological challenges and techniques and a relatively narrower application of adaptive learning, this study attempted to widen the application areas by making use of varied implementation techniques and a qualitative assessment of literature and a systematic selection and analysis of research studies. © 2022 Ani Publishing Ltd.

  abstract={Due to its increasing incidence, skin cancer, and especially melanoma, is a serious health disease today. The high mortality rate associated with melanoma makes it necessary to detect the early stages to be treated urgently and properly. This is the reason why many researchers in this domain wanted to obtain accurate computer-aided diagnosis systems to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of such diseases. The paper presents a systematic review of recent advances in an area of increased interest for cancer prediction, with a focus on a comparative perspective of melanoma detection using artificial intelligence, especially neural network-based systems. Such structures can be considered intelligent support systems for dermatologists. Theoretical and applied contributions were investigated in the new development trends of multiple neural network architecture, based on decision fusion. The most representative articles covering the area of melanoma detection based on neural networks, published in journals and impact conferences, were investigated between 2015 and 2021, focusing on the interval 2018–2021 as new trends. Additionally presented are the main databases and trends in their use in teaching neural networks to detect melanomas. Finally, a research agenda was highlighted to advance the field towards the new trends. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Digital transformation is driving the emergence of a new breed of organisations able to scale quickly, innovate throughout their processes, and lead industries and markets. In particular, the increasing adoption of cognitive technologies, like artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, high-performing computing and cyber-physical systems, allow organisations to create new value based on increased reactivity and resilience, situational awareness, agility and operational excellence. Although the idea of cognitive enterprise is rapidly emerging in the practitioner discussion, a theoretical framing of the concept is still not present in literature. We conduct a systematic review of extant contributions and we extract elements related to two key dimensions represented by the cognitive technological infrastructure (i.e. technologies and data) and the cognitive organizational architecture (i.e. processes and capabilities). We use the outcomes of the review work to define: (a) the pillars of the cognitive enterprise; (b) a framework of cognitive maturity stages; and (c) the enhanced value creation capabilities of the cognitive enterprise. The article provides a literature-derived definition of the cognitive enterprise and guidelines to support managers in the cognitive transformation of their organisations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Background: The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network enables access to billions of deidentified, standardized health records and built-in analytics software for observational health research, with numerous potential applications to dermatology. While the use of the OHDSI has increased steadily over the past several years, review of the literature reveals few studies utilizing OHDSI in dermatology. To our knowledge, the University of Colorado School of Medicine is unique in its use of OHDSI for dermatology big data research. Summary: A PubMed search was conducted in August 2020, followed by a literature review, with 24 of the 72 screened articles selected for inclusion. In this review, we discuss the ways OHDSI has been used to compile and analyze data, improve prediction and estimation capabilities, and inform treatment guidelines across specialties. We also discuss the potential for OHDSI in dermatology-specifically, ways that it could reveal adherence to available guidelines, establish standardized protocols, and ensure health equity. Key Messages: OHDSI has demonstrated broad utility in medicine. Adoption of OHDSI by the field of dermatology would facilitate big data research, allow for examination of current prescribing and treatment patterns without clear best practice guidelines, improve the dermatologic knowledge base and, by extension, improve patient outcomes.  © 2021 S.

  abstract={Diabetes Mellitus is a severe, chronic disease that occurs when blood glucose levels rise above certain limits. Over the last years, machine and deep learning techniques have been used to predict diabetes and its complications. However, researchers and developers still face two main challenges when building type 2 diabetes predictive models. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in previous studies regarding techniques used, making it challenging to identify the optimal one. Second, there is a lack of transparency about the features used in the models, which reduces their interpretability. This systematic review aimed at providing answers to the above challenges. The review followed the PRISMA methodology primarily, enriched with the one proposed by Keele and Durham Universities. Ninety studies were included, and the type of model, complementary techniques, dataset, and performance parameters reported were extracted. Eighteen different types of models were compared, with tree-based algorithms showing top performances. Deep Neural Networks proved suboptimal, despite their ability to deal with big and dirty data. Balancing data and feature selection techniques proved helpful to increase the model’s efficiency. Models trained on tidy datasets achieved almost perfect models. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The evidence of the impact of traditional statistical (TS) and artificial intelligence (AI) tool interventions in clinical practice was limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Introduction: The efficacy of antidepressants for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) varies from individual to individual, making the prediction of therapeutic outcomes difficult. Better methods for predicting antidepressant outcomes are needed. However, complex interactions between biological, psychological, and environmental factors affect outcomes, presenting immense computational challenges for prediction. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with pharmacogenomics data provides one pathway toward individualized prediction of therapeutic outcomes of antidepressants. Areas covered: This report systematically reviews the methods, results, and limitations of individual studies of ML and pharmacogenomics for predicting response and/or remission with antidepressants in patients with MDD. Future directions for research and pragmatic considerations for the clinical implementation of ML-based pharmacogenomic algorithms are also discussed. Expert opinion: ML methods utilizing pharmacogenomic and clinical data demonstrate promising results for predicting short-term antidepressant response. However, predictions of antidepressant treatment outcomes depend on contextual factors that ML algorithms may not be able to capture. As such, ML-driven prediction is best viewed as a companion to clinical judgment, not its replacement. Successful implementation and adoption of methods predicting antidepressant response warrants provider education about ML and close collaborations between computing scientists, pharmacogenomic experts, health system engineers, laboratory medicine experts, and clinicians. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Purpose: The popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has attracted worldwide research interest. This study aims to identify and summarize the research foci (e.g. themes, methods, contexts, etc.) and discuss the new directions and trends of MOOC research in the context of Mainland China. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of the published MOOC research papers in Mainland China was conducted with the following inclusion criteria: (1) papers written in English; (2) context focused on Mainland China; and (3) empirical studies. Three main issues were explored with the selected 70 papers: (1) research methods (data collection and analysis); (2) the research foci; and (3) research objects. Findings: The results found that the major MOOC research in China was quantitative, mostly using one method to collect data. Most studies collected data through the databases of MOOC platforms and survey techniques, which was consistent with the widely used descriptive statistics for data analysis. Learner-focused themes were investigated the most, aligning with the result that learners were the most popular research objects. Practical implications: The findings suggest that using new technology tools, such as the Big Data approach for learning analytics, may transform traditional MOOC research into new practices. Transdisciplinary research concepts may also provide an alternative evolving model for constructing collaboratively dynamic research frameworks under the changing technologies and paradigms. Meanwhile, educational research traditions, such as qualitative methods, contribute to scaffolding MOOC research for more pragmatic applications. Originality/value: Most systematic reviews on MOOCs focus on general or regional contexts other than Mainland China, and scant MOOC review is based on published English papers about Mainland China. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract={Digital pathology had a recent growth, stimulated by the implementation of digital whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical practice, and the pathology field faces shortage of pathologists in the last few years. This scenario created fronts of research applying artificial intelligence (AI) to help pathologists. One of them is the automated diagnosis, helping in the clinical decision support, increasing efficiency and quality of diagnosis. However, the complexity nature of the WSIs requires special treatments to create a reliable AI model for diagnosis. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to analyze and discuss all the methods and results in AI in digital pathology performed in WSIs on H&E stain, investigating the capacity of AI as a diagnostic support tool for the pathologist in the routine real-world scenario. This review analyzes 26 studies, reporting in detail all the best methods to apply AI as a diagnostic tool, as well as the main limitations, and suggests new ideas to improve the AI field in digital pathology as a whole. We hope that this study could lead to a better use of AI as a diagnostic tool in pathology, helping future researchers in the development of new studies and projects. © 2022 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objective: This article reports a systematic review of studies containing development and validation of models predicting postacute care destination after adult inpatient hospitalization, summarizes clinical populations and variables, evaluates model performance, assesses risk of bias and applicability, and makes recommendations to reduce bias in future models. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group criteria. Online databases were searched in June 2020 to identify all published studies in this area. Data were extracted based on the CHARMS checklist, and studies were evaluated based on predictor variables, validation, performance in validation, risk of bias, and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) tool. Results: The final sample contained 28 articles with 35 models for evaluation. Models focused on surgical (22), medical (5), or both (8) populations. Eighteen models were internally validated, 10 were externally validated, and 7 models underwent both types. Model performance varied within and across populations. Most models used retrospective data, the median number of predictors was 8.5, and most models demonstrated risk of bias. Discussion and Conclusion: Prediction modeling studies for postacute care destinations are becoming more prolific in the literature, but model development and validation strategies are inconsistent, and performance is variable. Most models are developed using regression, but machine learning methods are increasing in frequency. Future studies should ensure the rigorous variable selection and follow TRIPOD guidelines. Only 14% of the models have been tested or implemented beyond original studies, so translation into practice requires further investigation. © 2021 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Photo identification is an essential method to identify cetaceans, by using natural marks over their body, and allows experts to acquire straightforward information on these animals. The importance of cetaceans lies in te fact that they play a crucial role in maintaining the healthiness of marine ecosystems, however they are exposed to several anthropogenic stressors, under which they could collapse with extreme consequences on the marine ecosystem functioning. Hence, obtaining new knowledge on their status is extremely urgent for the marine biodiversity conservation. The smart use of technology to automate the individual recognition can speed up the photo identification process, opening the door to large-scale studies that are manually unfeasible. We performed a systematic review on systems based on machine learning and statistical methods for cetacean photo identification, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. This review highlights that interest has been increasing in recent years and several intelligent systems have been presented. However, there are still some open questions, and further efforts to develop more effective automated systems for cetacean photo identification are recommended.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Childhood obesity is a widespread medical condition and presents a formidable challenge for public health. Long-term treatment strategies and early prevention strategies are required because obese children are more likely to carry this condition into adulthood, increasing their risk of developing other major health disorders. The present review analyses various technological interventions available for childhood obesity prevention and treatment. It also examines whether machine learning and technological interventions can play vital roles in its management. Twenty-six studies were shortlisted for the review using various technological strategies and analysed regarding their efficacy. While most of the selected studies showed positive outcomes, there was a lack of studies using robots and artificial intelligence to manage obesity in children. The use of machine learning was observed in various studies, and the integration of social robots and other efficacious strategies may be effective for treating childhood obesity in the future. © 2022 Alotaibi et al.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer’s perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers’ intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract={Decision support clinical pathways are used to improve the performance of the health-care management system. An effective clinical pathway (CP) helps to know the optimal treatment route that patients will follow. The extent of the CP goes from the first contact in the health-center (or hospital) to the completion of the treatment until the patient is dismissed. Up to now, far too little attention has been paid to a systematic review, the research and the development of CPs in a low resource setting (LRS). The main focus has been primarily on data-intensive environments where there is no shortage of resources. A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science was conducted for bundling and categorizing the relevant approaches for LRS. Of 45 full reviewed articles, 25/45(55.6%) and 20/45(44.4%) of the studies were conducted using knowledge-based and data-driven approaches respectively. Among the knowledge-based studies, 9/25(36%) were reporting a stand-alone applications, 10/25(40%) attempting to deliver a paper-based CP, and the remaining focus was on web-based applications. In the data-driven approaches, 15/20(75%) tried to integrate with the electronic health record. The paper identifies the approaches for executing CPs and highlights key considerations for building LRS-compatible CPs. Data-driven CPs do not only resolve the challenges of improving the quality of existing knowledge-based CPs, but also enable evidence-based practice, improve outcomes, and reduce cost and delay. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

  abstract={Introduction: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common clinical pancreatic disease. Patients with different severity levels have different clinical outcomes. With the advantages of algorithms, machine learning (ML) has gradually emerged in the field of disease prediction, assisting doctors in decision-making. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Publication time was limited from inception to 29 May 2021. Studies that have used ML to establish predictive tools for AP were eligible for inclusion. Quality assessment of the included studies was conducted in accordance with the IJMEDI checklist. Results: In this systematic review, 24 of 2,913 articles, with a total of 8,327 patients and 47 models, were included. The studies could be divided into five categories: 10 studies (42%) reported severity prediction; 10 studies (42%), complication prediction; 3 studies (13%), mortality prediction; 2 studies (8%), recurrence prediction; and 2 studies (8%), surgery timing prediction. ML showed great accuracy in several prediction tasks. However, most of the included studies were retrospective in nature, conducted at a single centre, based on database data, and lacked external validation. According to the IJMEDI checklist and our scoring criteria, two studies were considered to be of high quality. Most studies had an obvious bias in the quality of data preparation, validation, and deployment dimensions. Conclusion: In the prediction tasks for AP, ML has shown great potential in assisting decision-making. However, the existing studies still have some deficiencies in the process of model construction. Future studies need to optimize the deficiencies and further evaluate the comparability of the ML systems and model performance, so as to consequently develop high-quality ML-based models that can be used in clinical practice. © 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract={More than a year has passed since the report of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID), and increasing deaths continue to occur. Minimizing the time required for resource allocation and clinical decision making, such as triage, choice of ventilation modes and admission to the intensive care unit is important. Machine learning techniques are acquiring an increasingly sought-after role in predicting the outcome of COVID patients. Particularly, the use of baseline machine learning techniques is rapidly developing in COVID mortality prediction, since a mortality prediction model could rapidly and effectively help clinical decision-making for COVID patients at imminent risk of death. Recent studies reviewed predictive models for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, severity, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation modes outcomes; however, systematic reviews focused on prediction of COVID mortality outcome with machine learning methods are lacking in the literature. The present review looked into the studies that implemented machine learning, including deep learning, methods in COVID mortality prediction thus trying to present the existing published literature and to provide possible explanations of the best results that the studies obtained. The study also discussed challenging aspects of current studies, providing suggestions for future developments. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes in the perioperative period. Given the increasing availability of electronic medical data, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with primary objectives of describing available frailty instruments applied to electronic data and synthesizing their prognostic value. Our secondary objectives were to assess the construct validity of frailty instruments that have been applied to perioperative electronic data and the feasibility of electronic frailty assessment. METHODS: Following protocol registration, a peer-reviewed search strategy was applied to Medline, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane databases, and the Comprehensive Index to Nursing and Allied Health literature from inception to December 31, 2019. All stages of the review were completed in duplicate. The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included nonhome discharge, health care costs, and length of stay. Effect estimates adjusted for baseline illness, sex, age, procedure, and urgency were of primary interest; unadjusted and adjusted estimates were pooled using random-effects models where appropriate or narratively synthesized. Risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS: Ninety studies were included; 83 contributed to the meta-analysis. Frailty was defined using 22 different instruments. In adjusted data, frailty identified from electronic data using any instrument was associated with a 3.57-fold increase in the odds of mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.68-4.75), increased odds of institutional discharge (odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% CI, 1.99-2.89), and increased costs (ratio of means, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.46-1.63). Most instruments were not multidimensional, head-to-head comparisons were lacking, and no feasibility data were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status derived from electronic data provides prognostic value as it is associated with adverse outcomes, even after adjustment for typical risk factors. However, future research is required to evaluate multidimensional instruments and their head-to-head performance and to assess their feasibility and clinical impact.

  abstract={In the recent century, two concepts "Deep Learning" (DL) and "Blockchain technology" have received much attention from around the globe. Today's DL [a superset of artificial neural networks, subset of Machine Learning (ML)] is being used rapidly in many sectors/fields, i.e., in methodological development and practical applications. DL offers many computational models which capture unfinished frameworks of massive data size, complementing majority of the hardware components, however it still faces a few challenges. Data analytics has gained extreme importance over the years and more data need to be analyzed to produce efficient results, leading to ML in HI. DL has proven to be a powerful tool under ML with many features and attributes. Similarly, DL is used in Medicare/bio-medical applications or biomedical informatics, i.e., clinical and HI. Hence, this chapter discusses the use of DL for imaging, i.e., clinical and HI, with a systematic review/ critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future prospects. This chapter discusses many key applications of DL in the fields of translational bioinformatics, bio-medical imaging, pervasive sensing, medical informatics, and public health including several essential issues, challenges, or opportunities in the same. © 2021 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

  abstract={Glioma is the most common primary intraparenchymal tumor of the brain and the 5-year survival rate of high-grade glioma is poor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for detecting, characterizing and monitoring brain tumors but definitive diagnosis still relies on surgical pathology. Machine learning has been applied to the analysis of MRI data in glioma research and has the potential to change clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes and analyzes the current state of machine learning applications to glioma MRI data and explores the use of machine learning for systematic review automation. Various datapoints were extracted from the 153 studies that met inclusion criteria and analyzed. Natural language processing (NLP) analysis involved keyword extraction, topic modeling and document classification. Machine learning has been applied to tumor grading and diagnosis, tumor segmentation, non-invasive genomic biomarker identification, detection of progression and patient survival prediction. Model performance was generally strong (AUC = 0.87 ± 0.09; sensitivity = 0.87 ± 0.10; specificity = 0.0.86 ± 0.10; precision = 0.88 ± 0.11). Convolutional neural network, support vector machine and random forest algorithms were top performers. Deep learning document classifiers yielded acceptable performance (mean 5-fold cross-validation AUC = 0.71). Machine learning tools and data resources were synthesized and summarized to facilitate future research. Machine learning has been widely applied to the processing of MRI data in glioma research and has demonstrated substantial utility. NLP and transfer learning resources enabled the successful development of a replicable method for automating the systematic review article screening process, which has potential for shortening the time from discovery to clinical application in medicine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The COVID-19 outbreak, along with post-pandemic impact has prompted Internet Plus education to re-examine numerous facets of technology-oriented academic research, particularly Educational Big Data (EBD). However, the unexpected transition from face-to-face offline education to online lessons has urged teachers to introduce educational technology into teaching practice, which has had an overwhelming impact on teachers' professional and personal lives. The aim of this present work is to fathom which research foci construct EBD in a comprehensive manner and how positive psychological indicators function in the technostress suffered by less agentic teachers. To this end, CiteSpace 5.7 and VOSviewer were applied to examine a longitudinal study of the literature from Web of Science Core Collection with the objective of uncovering the explicit patterns and knowledge structures in scientific network knowledge maps. Thousand seven hundred and eight articles concerned with educational data that met the criteria were extracted and analyzed. Research spanning 15 years was conducted to reveal that the knowledge base has accumulated dramatically after many governments' initiatives since 2012 with an accelerating annual growth and decreasing geographic imbalance. The review also identified some influential authors and journals whose effects will continue to have future implications. The authors identified several topical foci such as data mining, student performance, learning environment and psychology, learning analytics, and application. More specifically, the authors identified the scientific shift from data mining application to data privacy and educational psychology, from general scan to specific investigation. Among the conclusions, the results highlighted the important integration of educational psychology and technology during critical periods of educational development. Copyright © 2021 Li and Jiang.},

  abstract={Objectives This systematic review aimed to assess the performance and clinical feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithms in prediction of in-hospital mortality for medical patients using vital signs at emergency departments (EDs). Design A systematic review was performed. Setting The databases including Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Embase (Ovid) were searched between 2010 and 2021, to extract published articles in English, describing ML-based models utilising vital sign variables to predict in-hospital mortality for patients admitted at EDs. Critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies checklist was used for study planning and data extraction. The risk of bias for included papers was assessed using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool. Participants Admitted patients to the ED. Main outcome measure In-hospital mortality. Results Fifteen articles were included in the final review. We found that eight models including logistic regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, gradient boosting, random forest, artificial neural networks and deep neural networks have been applied in this domain. Most studies failed to report essential main analysis steps such as data preprocessing and handling missing values. Fourteen included studies had a high risk of bias in the statistical analysis part, which could lead to poor performance in practice. Although the main aim of all studies was developing a predictive model for mortality, nine articles did not provide a time horizon for the prediction. Conclusion This review provided an updated overview of the state-of-the-art and revealed research gaps; based on these, we provide eight recommendations for future studies to make the use of ML more feasible in practice. By following these recommendations, we expect to see more robust ML models applied in the future to help clinicians identify patient deterioration earlier.  ©},

  abstract={Obesity is considered a principal public health concern and ranked as the fifth foremost reason for death globally. Overweight and obesity are one of the main lifestyle illnesses that leads to further health concerns and contributes to numerous chronic diseases, including cancers, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization also predicted that 30% of death in the world will be initiated with lifestyle diseases in 2030 and can be stopped through the suitable identification and addressing of associated risk factors and behavioral involvement policies. Thus, detecting and diagnosing obesity as early as possible is crucial. Therefore, the machine learning approach is a promising solution to early predictions of obesity and the risk of overweight because it can offer quick, immediate, and accurate identification of risk factors and condition likelihoods. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine obesity research and machine learning techniques for the prevention and treatment of obesity from 2010 to 2020. Accordingly, 93 papers are identified from the review articles as primary studies from an initial pool of over 700 papers addressing obesity. Consequently, this study initially recognized the significant potential factors that influence and cause adult obesity. Next, the main diseases and health consequences of obesity and overweight are investigated. Ultimately, this study recognized the machine learning methods that can be used for the prediction of obesity. Finally, this study seeks to support decision-makers looking to understand the impact of obesity on health in the general population and identify outcomes that can be used to guide health authorities and public health to further mitigate threats and effectively guide obese people globally. © 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Objective To examine the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection of breast cancer in mammography screening practice. Design Systematic review of test accuracy studies. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women's digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. Study selection and synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. Results Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. Conclusions Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

  abstract={Despite the increasing demand for artificial intelligence research in medicine, the functionalities of his methods in health emergency remain unclear. Therefore, the authors have conducted this systematic review and a global overview study which aims to identify, analyse, and evaluate the research available on different platforms, and its implementations in healthcare emergencies. The methodology applied for the identification and selection of the scientific studies and the different applications consist of two methods. On the one hand, the PRISMA methodology was carried out in Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed ScienceDirect, and Scopus. On the other hand, a review of commercial applications found in the best-known commercial platforms (Android and iOS). A total of 20 studies were included in this review. Most of the included studies were of clinical decisions (n = 4, 20%) or medical services or emergency services (n = 4, 20%). Only 2 were focused on m-health (n = 2, 10%). On the other hand, 12 apps were chosen for full testing on different devices. These apps dealt with pre-hospital medical care (n = 3, 25%) or clinical decision support (n = 3, 25%). In total, half of these apps are based on machine learning based on natural language processing. Machine learning is increasingly applicable to healthcare and offers solutions to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare. With the emergence of mobile health devices and applications that can use data and assess a patient's real-time health, machine learning is a growing trend in the healthcare industry. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) is a symptom that may be caused by several diseases, and it is currently the leading cause of disability worldwide. The increased amount of digital images in orthopaedics has led to the development of methods related to artificial intelligence, and to computer vision in particular, which aim to improve diagnosis and treatment of LBP. In this manuscript, we have systematically reviewed the available literature on the use of computer vision in the diagnosis and treatment of LBP. A systematic research of PubMed electronic database was performed. The search strategy was set as the combinations of the following keywords: “Artificial Intelligence”, “Feature Extraction”, “Segmentation”, “Computer Vision”, “Machine Learning”, “Deep Learning”, “Neural Network”, “Low Back Pain”, “Lumbar”. Results: The search returned a total of 558 articles. After careful evaluation of the abstracts, 358 were excluded, whereas 124 papers were excluded after full-text examination, taking the number of eligible articles to 76. The main applications of computer vision in LBP include feature extraction and segmentation, which are usually followed by further tasks. Most recent methods use deep learning models rather than digital image processing techniques. The best performing methods for segmentation of vertebrae, intervertebral discs, spinal canal and lumbar muscles achieve Sørensen–Dice scores greater than 90%, whereas studies focusing on localization and identification of structures collectively showed an accuracy greater than 80%. Future advances in artificial intelligence are expected to increase systems’ autonomy and reliability, thus providing even more effective tools for the diagnosis and treatment of LBP. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Objectives: Machine learning platforms are now being introduced into modern oncological practice for classification and prediction of patient outcomes. To determine the current status of the application of these learning models as adjunctive decision-making tools in oral cavity cancer management, this systematic review aims to summarize the accuracy of machine-learning based models for disease outcomes. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, SciELO, PsychINFO, and Web of Science were searched up until December 21, 2020. Pertinent articles detailing the development and accuracy of machine learning prediction models for oral cavity cancer outcomes were selected in a two-stage process. Quality assessment was conducted using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool and results of base studies were qualitatively synthesized by all authors. Outcomes of interest were malignant transformation of precancer lesions, cervical lymph node metastasis, as well as treatment response, and prognosis of oral cavity cancer. Results: Twenty-seven articles out of 950 citations identified from electronic and manual searching were included in this study. Five studies had low bias concerns on the QUIPS tool. Prediction of malignant transformation, cervical lymph node metastasis, treatment response, and prognosis were reported in three, six, eight, and eleven articles respectively. Accuracy of these learning models on the internal or external validation sets ranged from 0.85 to 0.97 for malignant transformation prediction, 0.78–0.91 for cervical lymph node metastasis prediction, 0.64–1.00 for treatment response prediction, and 0.71–0.99 for prognosis prediction. In general, most trained algorithms predicting these outcomes performed better than alternate methods of prediction. We also found that models including molecular markers in training data had better accuracy estimates for malignant transformation, treatment response, and prognosis prediction. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms have a satisfactory to excellent accuracy for predicting three of four oral cavity cancer outcomes i.e., malignant transformation, nodal metastasis, and prognosis. However, considering the training approach of many available classifiers, these models may not be streamlined enough for clinical application currently. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), as well as the arrival of the big data era, technological innovations have occurred in the field of cardiovascular medicine. First, the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is highly dependent on assistive examinations, the interpretation of which is time consuming and often limited by the knowledge level and clinical experience of doctors; however, AI could be used to automatically interpret the images obtained in auxiliary examinations. Second, some of the predictions of the incidence and prognosis of CVDs are limited in clinical practice by the use of traditional prediction models, but there may be occasions when AI-based prediction models perform well by using ML algorithms. Third, AI has been used to assist precise classification of CVDs by integrating a variety of medical data from patients, which helps better characterize the subgroups of heterogeneous diseases. To help clinicians better understand the applications of AI in CVDs, this review summarizes studies relating to AI-based diagnosis, prediction, and classification of CVDs. Finally, we discuss the challenges of applying AI to cardiovascular medicine. © 2021 Japanese Circulation Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Impressive advances in inhalation therapy for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have occurred in recent years. However, important gaps in care remain, particularly relating to poor adherence to inhaled therapies. Digital inhaler health platforms which incorporate digital inhalers to monitor time and date of dosing are an effective disease and medication management tool, promoting collaborative care between clinicians and patients, and providing more in-depth understanding of actual inhaler use. With advances in technology, nearly all inhalers can be digitalized with add-on or embedded sensors to record and transmit data quantitating inhaler actuations, and some have additional capabilities to evaluate inhaler technique. In addition to providing an objective and readily available measure of adherence, they allow patients to interact with the device directly or through their self-management smartphone application such as via alerts and recording of health status. Clinicians can access these data remotely and during patient encounters, to better inform them about disease status and medication adherence and inhaler technique. The ability for remote patient monitoring is accelerating interest in and the use of these devices in clinical practice and research settings. More than 20 clinical studies of digital inhalers in asthma or COPD collectively show improvement in medication adherence, exacerbation risk, and patient outcomes with digital inhalers. These studies support previous findings about patient inhaler use and behaviors, but with greater granularity, and reveal some new findings about patient medication-taking behaviors. Digital devices that record inspiratory flows with inhaler use can guide proper inhaler technique and may prove to be a clinically useful lung function measure. Adoption of digital inhalers into practice is still early, and additional research is needed to determine patient and clinician acceptability, the appropriate place of these devices in the therapeutic regimen, and their cost effectiveness.

  abstract={Background: OncotypeDX® recurrence score (RS) aids therapeutic decision-making in oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Radiomics is an evolving field that aims to examine the relationship between radiological features and the underlying genomic landscape of disease processes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of current evidence evaluating the comparability of radiomics and RS. Methods: A systematic review was performed as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing radiomic MRI tumour analyses and RS were identified. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) delineating low risk (RS less than 18) versus intermediate-high risk (equal to or greater than 18) and low-intermediate risk (RS less than 30) and high risk (RS greater than 30) were recorded. Log rate ratios (lnRR) and standard error were determined from AUC and 95 per cent confidence intervals. Results: Nine studies including 1216 patients met inclusion criteria; the mean age at diagnosis was 52.9 years. Mean RS was 16 (range 0-75); 401 patients with RS less than 18, 287 patients with RS 18-30 and 100 patients with RS greater than 30. Radiomic analysis and RS were comparable for differentiating RS less than 18 versus RS 18 or greater (RR 0.93 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 1.01); P = 0.010, heterogeneity (I2)=0%) as well as RS less than 30 versus RS 30 or greater (RR 0.76 (95 per cent c.i. 0.70 to 0.83); P < 0.001, I2=0%). MRI sensitivity and specificity for RS less than 18 versus 18 or greater was 0.89 (95 per cent c.i. 0.85 to 0.93) and 0.72 (95 per cent c.i. 0.66 to 0.78) respectively, and 0.79 (95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 0.86) and 0.74 (95 per cent c.i. 0.68 to 0.80) for RS less than 30 versus 30 or greater. Conclusion: Radiomic tumour analysis is comparable to RS in differentiating patients into clinically relevant subgroups. For patients requiring MRI, radiomics may complement and enhance RS for prognostication and therapeutic decision making in ER+ breast cancer.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract={Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) form an implementation strategy that can facilitate and support health care professionals in the care of older hospitalized patients. Objective: Our study aims to systematically review the effects of CDSS interventions in older hospitalized patients. As a secondary aim, we aim to summarize the implementation and design factors described in effective and ineffective interventions and identify gaps in the current literature. Methods: We conducted a systematic review with a search strategy combining the categories older patients, geriatric topic, hospital, CDSS, and intervention in the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS. We included controlled studies, extracted data of all reported outcomes, and potentially beneficial design and implementation factors. We structured these factors using the Grol and Wensing Implementation of Change model, the GUIDES (Guideline Implementation with Decision Support) checklist, and the two-stream model. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk of bias approach. Results: Our systematic review included 18 interventions, of which 13 (72%) were effective in improving care. Among these interventions, 8 (6 effective) focused on medication review, 8 (6 effective) on delirium, 7 (4 effective) on falls, 5 (4 effective) on functional decline, 4 (3 effective) on discharge or aftercare, and 2 (0 effective) on pressure ulcers. In 77% (10/13) effective interventions, the effect was based on process-related outcomes, in 15% (2/13) interventions on both process- and patient-related outcomes, and in 8% (1/13) interventions on patient-related outcomes. The following implementation and design factors were potentially associated with effectiveness: a priori problem or performance analyses (described in 9/13, 69% effective vs 0/5, 0% ineffective interventions), multifaceted interventions (8/13, 62% vs 1/5, 20%), and consideration of the workflow (9/13, 69% vs 1/5, 20%). Conclusions: CDSS interventions can improve the hospital care of older patients, mostly on process-related outcomes. We identified 2 implementation factors and 1 design factor that were reported more frequently in articles on effective interventions. More studies with strong designs are needed to measure the effect of CDSS on relevant patient-related outcomes, investigate personalized (data-driven) interventions, and quantify the impact of implementation and design factors on CDSS effectiveness.

  abstract={Aim: To identify and critically appraise studies of prediction models, developed using machine learning (ML) methods, for determining the optimal dosing of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Methods: Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and IEEE Xplore databases were searched from inception to 31 January 2020 to identify relevant studies using key search terms synonymous with artificial intelligence or ML, ‘prediction’, ‘dose’, ‘activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)’ and ‘UFH.’ Studies had to have used ML methods for developing models that predicted optimal dose of UFH or target therapeutic aPTT levels in the hospital setting. The CHARMS Checklist was used to assess quality and risk of bias of included studies. Results: Of 8393 retrieved abstracts, 61 underwent full text review and eight studies met inclusion criteria. Four studies described models for predicting aPTT, three studies described models predicting optimal dose of heparin during dialysis and one study described a model that used surrogate outcomes of clotting and bleeding to predict a therapeutic aPTT. Studies varied widely in reporting of study participants, feature characterisation and selection, handling of missing data, sample size calculations and the intended clinical application of the model. Only one study conducted an external validation and no studies evaluated model impacts in clinical practice. Conclusion: Studies of ML models for UFH dosing are few and none report a model ready for routine clinical use. Existing studies are limited by low methodological quality, inadequate reporting of study factors and absence of external validation and impact analysis. © 2021 British Pharmacological Society},

  abstract={Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various ways in medicine and dentistry. Advancements in AI technology show promising results in the practice of orthodontics. This scoping review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of AI-based models employed in orthodontic landmark detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Methods: A precise search of electronic databases was conducted, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase (English publications from January 2010 to July 2020). Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the quality of the articles included in this review. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 49 articles were included in the final review. AI technology has achieved state-of-the-art results in various orthodontic applications, including automated landmark detection on lateral cephalograms and photography images, cervical vertebra maturation degree determination, skeletal classification, orthodontic tooth extraction decisions, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery, and facial attractiveness. Most of the AI models used in these applications are based on artificial neural networks. Conclusions: AI can help orthodontists save time and provide accuracy comparable to the trained dentists in diagnostic assessments and prognostic predictions. These systems aim to boost performance and enhance the quality of care in orthodontics. However, based on current studies, the most promising application was cephalometry landmark detection, skeletal classification, and decision making on tooth extractions. © 2021 American Association of Orthodontists},

  abstract={Glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis. Even though survival statistics are well-described at the population level, it remains challenging to predict the prognosis of an individual patient despite the increasing number of prognostic models. The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature on prognostic modeling in glioblastoma patients. A systematic literature search was performed to identify all relevant studies that developed a prognostic model for predicting overall survival in glioblastoma patients following the PRISMA guidelines. Participants, type of input, algorithm type, validation, and testing procedures were reviewed per prognostic model. Among 595 citations, 27 studies were included for qualitative review. The included studies developed and evaluated a total of 59 models, of which only seven were externally validated in a different patient cohort. The predictive performance among these studies varied widely according to the AUC (0.58–0.98), accuracy (0.69–0.98), and C-index (0.66–0.70). Three studies deployed their model as an online prediction tool, all of which were based on a statistical algorithm. The increasing performance of survival prediction models will aid personalized clinical decision-making in glioblastoma patients. The scientific realm is gravitating towards the use of machine learning models developed on high-dimensional data, often with promising results. However, none of these models has been implemented into clinical care. To facilitate the clinical implementation of high-performing survival prediction models, future efforts should focus on harmonizing data acquisition methods, improving model interpretability, and externally validating these models in multicentered, prospective fashion. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Therapeutic decision-making in oncology is a complex process because physicians must consider many forms of medical data and protocols. Another challenge for physicians is to clearly communicate their decision-making process to patients to ensure informed consent. Computer-based decision tools have the potential to play a valuable role in supporting this process. Objective: This systematic review aims to investigate the extent to which computer-based decision tools have been successfully adopted in oncology consultations to improve patient-physician joint therapeutic decision-making. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 checklist and guidelines. A literature search was conducted on February 4, 2021, across the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 2005 to January 28, 2021), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (December 2020), MEDLINE (from 1946 to February 4, 2021), Embase (from 1947 to February 4, 2021), Web of Science (from 1900 to 2021), Scopus (from 1969 to 2021), and PubMed (from 1991 to 2021). We used a snowball approach to identify additional studies by searching the reference lists of the studies included for full-text review. Additional supplementary searches of relevant journals and gray literature websites were conducted. The reviewers screened the articles eligible for review for quality and inclusion before data extraction. Results: There are relatively few studies looking at the use of computer-based decision tools in oncology consultations. Of the 4431 unique articles obtained from the searches, only 10 (0.22%) satisfied the selection criteria. From the 10 selected studies, 8 computer-based decision tools were identified. Of the 10 studies, 6 (60%) were conducted in the United States. Communication and information-sharing were improved between physicians and patients. However, physicians did not change their habits to take advantage of computer-assisted decision-making tools or the information they provide. On average, the use of these computer-based decision tools added approximately 5 minutes to the total length of consultations. In addition, some physicians felt that the technology increased patients' anxiety. Conclusions: Of the 10 selected studies, 6 (60%) demonstrated positive outcomes, 1 (10%) showed negative results, and 3 (30%) were neutral. Adoption of computer-based decision tools during oncology consultations continues to be low. This review shows that information-sharing and communication between physicians and patients can be improved with the assistance of technology. However, the lack of integration with electronic health records is a barrier. This review provides key requirements for enhancing the chance of success of future computer-based decision tools. However, it does not show the effects of health care policies, regulations, or business administration on physicians' propensity to adopt the technology. Nevertheless, it is important that future research address the influence of these higher-level factors as well. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc.},

  abstract={Student's performance is a success factor in higher education institutions. The excellent record of academic achievements raises the institution's ranking as one of the criteria for a high-quality university. Predicting and analyzing the performance of the student is essential to assist educators in identifying weaknesses and enhancing the academic scores. However, achieving accurate predictions is challenging due to huge amount of educational data. The main reason behind this, is the lack of research on exploring different prediction methods and key attributes that influence the student's academic performance. Hence, this systematic review intends to explore the current machine learning methods and attributes used in predicting the student's performance. Several online databases were used to perform a systematic search of data-driven studies. The analysis and assessment of 30 selected articles revealed five main prediction methods: artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision trees, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and naïve Bayes. Our findings revealed that the ANN method has the best performance with a high level of accuracy. Demographic, academic, family/personal and internal assessment were found to be the most frequently used attributes in prediction the student performance. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: To better select patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) for an optimal selection of treatment strategy (i.e. local, systemic or combined treatment) new prognostic models are warranted. In the last decade, radiomics has emerged as a field to create predictive models based on imaging features. This systematic review aims to investigate the current state and potential of radiomics to predict clinical outcomes in patients with CRLM. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, according to PRISMA guidelines. Original studies reporting on radiomics predicting clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with CRLM were included. Clinical outcomes were defined as response to systemic treatment, recurrence of disease, and survival (overall, progression-free, disease-free). Primary outcome was the predictive performance of radiomics. A narrative synthesis of the results was made. Methodological quality was assessed using the radiomics quality score. Results: In 11 out of 14 included studies, radiomics was predictive for response to treatment, recurrence of disease, survival, or a combination of outcomes. Combining clinical parameters and radiomic features in multivariate modelling often improved the predictive performance. Different types of individual features were found prognostic. Noticeable were the contrary levels of heterogeneous and homogeneous features in patients with good response. The methodological quality as assessed by the radiomics quality score varied considerably between studies. Conclusion: Radiomics appears a promising non-invasive method to predict clinical outcome and improve personalized decision-making in patients with CRLM. However, results were contradictory and difficult to compare. Standardized prospective studies are warranted to establish the added value of radiomics in patients with CRLM. © 2021},

  abstract={Clinicians working in the field of acquired brain injury (ABI, an injury to the brain sustained after birth) are challenged to develop suitable care pathways for an individual client’s needs. Being able to predict psychosocial outcomes after ABI would enable clinicians and service providers to make advance decisions and better tailor care plans. Machine learning (ML, a predictive method from the field of artificial intelligence) is increasingly used for predicting ABI outcomes. This review aimed to examine the efficacy of using ML to make psychosocial predictions in ABI, evaluate the methodological quality of studies, and understand researchers’ rationale for their choice of ML algorithms. Nine studies were reviewed from five databases, predicting a range of psychosocial outcomes from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and concussion. Eleven types of ML were employed with a total of 75 ML models. Every model was evaluated as having high risk of bias, unable to provide adequate evidence for predictive performance due to poor methodological quality. Overall, there was limited rationale for the choice of ML algorithms and poor evaluation of the methodological limitations by study authors. Considerations for overcoming methodological shortcomings are discussed, along with suggestions for assessing the suitability of data and suitability of ML algorithms for different ABI research questions. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract={Introduction: We aimed to assess whether machine learning models are superior at predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to logistic regression (LR), a conventional prediction model. Methods: Eligible studies were identified using PubMed and Embase. A total of 24 studies consisting of 84 prediction models met inclusion criteria. Independent samples t-test was performed to detect mean differences in area under the curve (AUC) between ML and LR models. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests were performed to assess mean differences in AUC between ML methods. Results: AUC data were similar between ML (0.736 ± 0.116) and LR (0.748 ± 0.057) models (p = 0.538). However, specific ML models, such as gradient boosting (0.838 ± 0.077), exhibited superior performance at predicting AKI as compared to other ML models in the literature (p < 0.05). Creatinine and urine output, standard variables assessed for AKI staging, were classified as significant predictors across multiple ML models, although the majority of significant predictors were unique and study specific. Conclusions: These data suggest that ML models perform equally to that of LR, however ML models exhibit variable performance with some ML models displaying exceptional performance. The variability in ML prediction of AKI can be attributed, in part, to the specific ML model utilized, variable selection and processing, study and subject characteristics, and the steps associated with model training, validation, testing, and calibration. © 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Background: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of worldwide years lost because of disability, with a tremendous economic burden for health care systems. Digital therapeutic care (DTC) programs provide a scalable, universally accessible, and low-cost approach to the multidisciplinary treatment of LBP. Moreover, novel decision support interventions such as personalized feedback messages, push notifications, and data-driven activity recommendations amplify DTC by guiding the user through the program while aiming to increase overall engagement and sustainable behavior change. Objective: This systematic review aims to synthesize recent scientific literature on the impact of DTC apps for people with LBP and outline the implementation of add-on decision support interventions, including their effect on user retention and attrition rates. Methods: We searched bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from March 1, 2016, to October 15, 2020, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and conducted this review based on related previously published systematic reviews. Besides randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also included study designs with the evidence level of at least a retrospective comparative study. This enables the consideration of real-world user-generated data and provides information regarding the adoption and effectiveness of DTC apps in a real-life setting. For the appraisal of the risk of bias, we used the Risk of Bias 2 Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool for the RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. The included studies were narratively synthesized regarding primary and secondary outcome measures, DTC components, applied decision support interventions, user retention, and attrition rates. Results: We retrieved 1388 citations, of which 12 studies are included in this review. Of the 12 studies, 6 (50%) were RCTs and 6 (50%) were nonrandomized trials. In all included studies, lower pain levels and increased functionality compared with baseline values were observed in the DTC intervention group. A between-group comparison revealed significant improvements in pain and functionality levels in 67% (4/6) of the RCTs. The study population was mostly homogeneous, with predominantly female, young to middle-aged participants of normal to moderate weight. The methodological quality assessment revealed moderate to high risks of biases, especially in the nonrandomized trials. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of DTC for people with LBP. There is also evidence that decision support interventions benefit overall engagement with the app and increase participants’ ability to self-manage their recovery process. Finally, including retrospective evaluation studies of real-world user-generated data in future systematic reviews of digital health intervention trials can reveal new insights into the benefits, challenges, and real-life adoption of DTC programs. © Daniel Lewkowicz, Tamara Slosarek, Sarah Wernicke, Antonia Winne, Attila M Wohlbrandt, Erwin Bottinger.},

  abstract={Introduction: Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home. Objective: Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt. Methods: We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions. Results: Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching. Conclusion: Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of well-being, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={Machine learning is emerging nowadays as an important tool for decision support in many areas of research. In the field of education, both educational organizations and students are the target beneficiaries. It facilitates the educational sector in predicting the student’s outcome at the end of their course and for the students in deciding to choose a suitable course for them based on their performances in previous exams and other behavioral features. In this study, a systematic literature review is performed to extract the algorithms and the features that have been used in the prediction studies. Based on the search criteria, 2700 articles were initially considered. Using specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality scores were provided, and up to 56 articles were filtered for further analysis. The utmost care was taken in studying the features utilized, database used, algorithms implemented, and the future directions as recommended by researchers. The features were classified as demographic, academic, and behavioral features, and finally, only 34 articles with these features were finalized, whose details of study are provided. Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability to predict the students’ performance based on specified features as categorized and can be used by students as well as academic institutions. A specific machine learning model identification for the purpose of student academic performance prediction would not be feasible, since each paper taken for review involves different datasets and does not include benchmark datasets. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in educational mining is still limited, and a greater number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Background: Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians by focusing their clinical evaluation on the most important signs and symptoms, and if used properly can reduce the need for diagnostic testing. This study aims to perform an updated systematic review of clinical prediction rules and classification and regression tree (CART) models for the diagnosis of influenza. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. We identified prospective studies of patients presenting with suspected influenza or respiratory infection and that reported a CPR in the form of a risk score or CART-based algorithm. Studies had to report at a minimum the percentage of patients in each risk group with influenza. Studies were evaluated for inclusion and data were extracted by reviewers working in parallel. Accuracy was summarized descriptively; where not reported by the authors the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results: We identified 10 studies that presented 14 CPRs. The most commonly included predictor variables were cough, fever, chills and/or sweats, myalgias, and acute onset, all which can be ascertained by phone or telehealth visit. Most CPRs had an AUROCC between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating good discrimination. However, only 1 rule has undergone prospective external validation, with limited success. Data reporting by the original studies was in some cases inadequate to determine measures of accuracy. Conclusions: Well-designed validation studies, studies of interrater reliability between telehealth an in-person assessment, and studies using novel data mining and artificial intelligence strategies are needed to improve diagnosis of this common and important infection. © 2021 American Board of Family Medicine.

  abstract={Suicidal ideation is one of the severe mental health issues and a serious social problem faced by our society. This problem has been usually dealt with through the psychological point of view, using clinical face to face settings. There are various risk factors associated with suicides, including social isolation, anxiety, depression, etc., that decrease the threshold for suicide. The COVID-19 pandemic further increases social isolation, posing a great threat to the human population. Posting suicidal thoughts on social media is gaining much attention due to the social stigma associated with the mental health. Online Social Networks (OSN) are increasingly used to express the suicidal thoughts. Recently, a top Indian actor industry took the harsh step of suicide. The last Instagram posts revealed signs of depression, which if anticipated could have saved the precious life. Recent research indicated that the public information on social media provides valuable insights on detecting the users with the suicidal ideation. The motive of this study is to provide a systematic review of the work done already in the use of social media for suicide prevention and propose a novel classification approach that classifies the suicide related tweets/posts into three levels of distress. Moreover, our proposed classification task which was implemented through various machine learning techniques revealed high accuracy in classifying the suicidal posts. Among all algorithms, the best performing algorithm was that of the decision tree, with an F1 score ranging 0.95-0.97. After thoroughly studying the work achieved by different researchers in the area of suicide prevention, our study critically analyses those works and finds various research gaps and solves some of them. We believe that our work will motivate research community to look into other gaps that will in turn help psychiatrists, psychologists, and counsellors to protect individuals suffering from suicidal ideation. © 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science.

  abstract={Decision-making in cancer treatment is part of clinicians’ everyday work, and it is especially challenging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, for whom decisions are clearly dependent on gene alterations or the lack of them. The multimodality of treatments, involvement of gene alterations in defining systemic cancer therapies, and heterogeneous nature of tumors and their responsiveness provide extra challenges. This article reviews the existing literature to 2021 with extra effort to explore the role of genes and gene-driven therapies as part of decision-making. The process and elements in this decision-making participation are recognized and discussed comprehensively. Genetic health literacy aids are provided as a part of the review. Our systematic review, data extraction and analysis found that with current methods and broad gene panels, patients benefit from early molecular testing of liquid biopsy samples. An estimated 79% of liquid biopsy samples showed somatic mutations based on 8 original studies included in the systematic review. When both liquid biopsy samples and tissue samples are evaluated, the sensitivity to detect targetable mutations in NSCLC increases. We recommend early testing with liquid biopsy. Additional effort is needed for the logistics of obtaining and evaluating samples, and tissue samples should be saved and stored for tests that are not possible from liquid biopsy.

  abstract={Background Chest pain is amongst the most common reason for presentation to the emergency department (ED). There are many causes of chest pain, and it is important for the emergency physician to quickly and accurately diagnose life threatening causes such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Multiple clinical decision tools have been developed to assist clinicians in risk stratifying patients with chest. There is growing recognition that machine learning (ML) will have a significant impact on the practice of medicine in the near future and may assist with diagnosis and risk stratification. This systematic review aims to evaluate how ML has been applied to adults presenting to the ED with undifferentiated chest pain and assess if ML models show improved performance when compared to physicians or current risk stratification techniques. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review of journal articles that applied a ML technique to an adult patient presenting to an emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain. Multiple databases were searched from inception through to November 2020. In total, 3361 articles were screened, and 23 articles were included. We did not conduct a metanalysis due to a high level of heterogeneity between studies in both their methods, and reporting. The most common primary outcomes assessed were diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (12 studies), and prognosis of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (6 studies). There were 14 retrospective studies and 5 prospective studies. Four studies reported the development of a machine learning model retrospectively then tested it prospectively. The most common machine learning methods used were artificial neural networks (14 studies), random forest (6 studies), support vector machine (5 studies), and gradient boosting (2 studies). Multiple studies achieved high accuracy in both the diagnosis of AMI in the ED setting, and in predicting mortality and composite outcomes over various timeframes. ML outperformed existing risk stratification scores in all cases, and physicians in three out of four cases. The majority of studies were single centre, retrospective, and without prospective or external validation. There were only 3 studies that were considered low risk of bias and had low applicability concerns. Two studies reported integrating the ML model into clinical practice. Conclusions Research on applications of ML for undifferentiated chest pain in the ED has been ongoing for decades. ML has been reported to outperform emergency physicians and current risk stratification tools to diagnose AMI and predict MACE but has rarely been integrated into practice. Many studies assessing the use of ML in undifferentiated chest pain in the ED have a high risk of bias. It is important that future studies make use of recently developed standardised ML reporting guidelines, register their protocols, and share their datasets and code. Future work is required to assess the impact of ML model implementation on clinical decision making, patient orientated outcomes, and patient and physician acceptability. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

  abstract={Purpose: The method of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) through artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems has been commercially available since 2018. This introduces new ethical challenges with regard to obtaining informed consent from patients. The purpose of this work is to develop a checklist of items to be disclosed when diagnosing DR with AI systems in a primary care setting. Methods: Two systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science databases: a narrow search focusing on DR and a broad search on general issues of AI-based diagnosis. An ethics content analysis was conducted inductively to extract two features of included publications: (1) novel information content for AI-aided diagnosis and (2) the ethical justification for its disclosure. Results: The narrow search yielded n = 537 records of which n = 4 met the inclusion criteria. The information process was scarcely addressed for primary care setting. The broad search yielded n = 60 records of which n = 11 were included. In total, eight novel elements were identified to be included in the information process for ethical reasons, all of which stem from the technical specifics of medical AI. Conclusions: Implications for the general practitioner are two-fold: First, doctors need to be better informed about the ethical implications of novel technologies and must understand them to properly inform patients. Second, patient's overconfidence or fears can be countered by communicating the risks, limitations, and potential benefits of diagnostic AI systems. If patients accept and are aware of the limitations of AI-aided diagnosis, they increase their chances of being diagnosed and treated in time. © Copyright © 2021 Ursin, Timmermann, Orzechowski and Steger.},

  abstract={Background: Along with the vigorous development of "Internet plus healthcare", various information technologies(ITs) have been applied to general practices to varying degrees in China. However, studies on domestic "Internet plus general practices" are still very limited compared to those on "Internet plus specialty practices". Objective: To review the typical applications of ITs in general practices abroad and relevant research topics to reveal the research hot topics and future trend in this field, providing insights into general medicine research and practices in China. Methods: We searched the electronic version of top 10 SCI-indexed primary healthcare journals ranked by the JCR in terms of the value of impact factors in 2020 for articles about ITs used in general practices abroad using seven search terms: Information Technology, Information and Communication Technology, Internet, Web 2.0, Social Media, Online Health Community, and Online Support Group. Inductive and comparative analyses of the typical applications and research hotspots were performed. Results: The typical IT applications in general practices abroad include developing national electronic medical record systems, intensive application of data, decision support systems for general practitioners, video consultation and other alternative virtual consultations, intra- or inter-team collaboration of general practice teams, data collection outside hospitals, and publicity and demonstration of general practice teams. Research topics include the usefulness of IT applications in general practices, technology adoption and continuous use by general practice teams and patients, IT-enabled patient education and general practice education, intensive application of electronic medical records, and ethical issues related to IT use in general practices. Conclusion: This review recommends the following measures to be taken to promote domestic application of ITs in general practices against the backdrop of developing general practice and electronic medical record system backed by the Chinese government: Proactively using new and emerging ITs to build an IT-enabled general practice service ecosystem. For example, using the 5G technology to improve remote medical services, the service capacity of community healthcare settings, the services delivered by a regional medical consortium, the development of a tiered healthcare system and the services by the general practitioner as a gatekeeper. Using the informationization level of electronic medical record system as an evaluation criterion for hospitals, for example, hospitals should use grade 9 electronic medical record system to report data to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, thereby promoting the building of a national electronic medical record system. Strengthening the construction of integrity and continuity of patient data management system using ITs, and improving the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment decisions made by general practitioners using machine-learning and other big data algorithms. Encouraging the implementation of interdisciplinary studies by general practice teams in collaboration with researchers in the field of information management and system, to promote domestic development of general medicine practice and research comprehensively.

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize the healthcare system, leading to enhance efficiency by automatizing routine tasks and decreasing health-related costs, broadening access to healthcare delivery, targeting more precisely patient needs, and assisting clinicians in their decision-making. For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT’s distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs’ exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system. © Copyright © 2021 Bélisle-Pipon, Couture, Roy, Ganache, Goetghebeur and Cohen.},

The systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Recent Findings: This review discusses the newer advancements in AI-driven management strategies, which holds great promise to provide an essential step for personalized patient care and improved decision making. AI has been used in all areas of KSD including diagnosis, for predicting treatment suitability and success, basic science, quality of life (QOL), and recurrence of stone disease. However, it is still a research-based tool and is not used universally in clinical practice. This could be due to a lack of data infrastructure needed to train the algorithms, wider applicability in all groups of patients, complexity of its use and cost involved with it. Summary: The constantly evolving literature and future research should focus more on QOL and the cost of KSD treatment and develop evidence-based AI algorithms that can be used universally, to guide urologists in the management of stone disease. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The advances in technology to capture and process unprecedented amounts of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs’ theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing LAD’s target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs’ intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs’ target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users. Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners’ behaviour, achievement and skills. What this paper adds This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning analytics dashboard studies. The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics dashboards. Implications for practice and/or policy Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome). The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards. The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.},

  abstract={The technological advancement and rapid development of artificial intelligence have led to a growing number of studies investigating pedagogical innovations incorporated with emerging technologies in this digital era. An increasing amount of empirical evidence has suggested the potential benefits of incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence in various educational contexts, such as the K-12 education, and a change in learning modality in the unprecedented period of COVID-19. In chemical education, various types of emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking techniques, learning analytics, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), have seen wide applications and promising prospects. In this paper, a systematic review of emerging technologies adopted in chemical education during this era of digitalization and artificial intelligence is presented. The current study aims to identify the major types of technologies adopted in chemical education and analyze the empirical findings from relevant studies. A total of 45 studies between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed through a literature search in three inter-disciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and the Educational Information Resource Center. Full-text retrieval and analysis of the included studies were conducted. The present study finds that AR and VR applications were most extensively investigated among the identified types of technologies adopted in chemical education, while the major focus areas were associated with virtual chemistry laboratories, visualization and interaction with chemical structures, and classroom hands-on activities. The evidence presented in this study also indicates the promising applications of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in the analysis of students’ feedback and behavior, assessment of students’ understanding of chemical concepts, and investigations of students’ reasoning and cognitive processes during chemical tasks such as spectral interpretation. Furthermore, areas requiring more research, investigations, potential future applications, as well as pedagogical implications of education for sustainable development will be identified based on the evidence presented in this study. The findings of this study are expected to give insight on the evolving areas of chemical education research and technology-enhanced teaching and learning. © 2021 by the author.

We present our paper which reviews various existing techniques for suicidal ideation prediction. These techniques are broadly divided into two major categories - 1) Text-based indicators (which employ NLP) and 2) Behavioural indicators (like eye gaze and smile which are classified using ML algorithms). The existing techniques aim at classifying individuals as suicidal or non-suicidal using classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron and XGBoost. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. We aim to bring all these diverse techniques to one place and try to show how each one of them is individually contributing to prediction. We also shed light on how combining these techniques and eliminating the disadvantages could lead to better suicide prediction. © 2021 IEEE.},

Results: There has been a considerable rise over the past 5 years in the number of research papers using ML-based analysis for AD dementia modeling. We reviewed 64 relevant articles in our SLR. The results suggest that majority of existing research has focused on predicting progression of AD dementia using publicly available datasets containing both neuroimaging and clinical data (neurobehavioral status exam scores, patient demographics, neuroimaging data, and laboratory test values). Discussion: Identifying individuals at risk for progression of AD dementia could potentially help to personalize disease management to plan future care. Clinical data consisting of both structured data tables and clinical notes can be effectively used in ML-based approaches to model risk for AD dementia progression. Data sharing and reproducibility of results can enhance the impact, adaptation, and generalizability of this research.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) has garnered increasing attention as a means to quantitatively analyze the growing and complex medical data to improve individualized patient care. We herein aim to critically examine the current state of ML in predicting surgical outcomes, evaluate the quality of currently available research, and propose areas of improvement for future uses of ML in surgery. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were reviewed under search syntax “machine learning” and “surgery” for papers published between 2015 and 2020. Results: Of the initial 2677 studies, 45 papers met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen different subspecialties were represented with neurosurgery being most common. The most frequently used ML algorithms were random forest (n = 19), artificial neural network (n = 17), and logistic regression (n = 17). Common outcomes included postoperative mortality, complications, patient reported quality of life and pain improvement. All studies which compared ML algorithms to conventional studies which used area under the curve (AUC) to measure accuracy found improved outcome prediction with ML models. Conclusions: While still in its early stages, ML models offer surgeons an opportunity to capitalize on the myriad of clinical data available and improve individualized patient care. Limitations included heterogeneous outcome and imperfect quality of some of the papers. We therefore urge future research to agree upon methods of outcome reporting and require basic quality standards. © 2021},

  abstract={Background: A growing body of literature has detailed the use of qualitative analyses to measure the therapeutic processes and intrinsic effectiveness of psychotherapies, which yield small databases. Nonetheless, these approaches have several limitations and machine learning algorithms are needed. Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the use of machine learning for automated text classification for small data sets in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences. This review will identify available algorithms and assess if automated classification of textual entities is comparable to the classification done by human evaluators. Methods: A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases of Medline, Web of Science, PsycNet (PsycINFO), and Google Scholar from their inception dates to 2021. The fields of psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences were selected as they include a vast array of textual entities in the domain of mental health that can be reviewed. Additional records identified through cross-referencing were used to find other studies. Results: This literature search identified 5442 articles that were eligible for our study after the removal of duplicates. Following abstract screening, 114 full articles were assessed in their entirety, of which 107 were excluded. The remaining 7 studies were analyzed. Classification algorithms such as naive Bayes, decision tree, and support vector machine classifiers were identified. Support vector machine is the most used algorithm and best performing as per the identified articles. Prediction classification scores for the identified algorithms ranged from 53%-91% for the classification of textual entities in 4-7 categories. In addition, 3 of the 7 studies reported an interjudge agreement statistic; these were consistent with agreement statistics for text classification done by human evaluators. Conclusions: A systematic review of available machine learning algorithms for automated text classification for small data sets in several fields (psychiatry, psychology, and social sciences) was conducted. We compared automated classification with classification done by human evaluators. Our results show that it is possible to automatically classify textual entities of a transcript based solely on small databases. Future studies are nevertheless needed to assess whether such algorithms can be implemented in the context of psychotherapies. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Advancement in genome sequencing technology has empowered researchers to think beyond their imagination. Researchers are trying their hard to fight against various genetic diseases such as cancer. Artificial intelligence has empowered research in the healthcare sector. The availability of open-source healthcare datasets has motivated the researchers to develop applications which helps in early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Further, Next-generation sequencing has helped to look into detailed intricacies of biological systems. It has provided an efficient and cost-effective approach with higher accuracy. The advent of microRNAs also known as small noncoding genes has begun the paradigm shift in oncological research. We are now able to profile expression profiles of RNAs using RNA-seq data. microRNA profiling has helped in uncovering their relationship in various genetic and biological processes. Here in this paper, we present a review of the machine learning perspective in cancer research. The best way to develop effective cancer treatment/drugs is to better understand the intricacies and complexities involved in the cancer microenvironment. Although there has been a plethora of methods and techniques proposed in the literature, still the deadliness of cancer can't be reduced. In such a situation Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning is providing a reliable, fast, and efficient way to deal with such stringent diseases. © 2021, CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.},

  abstract={Rapid advancements in high-throughput omics technologies and experimental protocols have led to the generation of vast amounts of scale-specific biomolecular data on cancer that now populates several online databases and resources. Cancer systems biology models built using this data have the potential to provide specific insights into complex multifactorial aberrations underpinning tumor initiation, development, and metastasis. Furthermore, the annotation of these single- and multi-scale models with patient data can additionally assist in designing personalized therapeutic interventions as well as aid in clinical decision-making. Here, we have systematically reviewed the emergence and evolution of (i) repositories with scale-specific and multi-scale biomolecular cancer data, (ii) systems biology models developed using this data, (iii) associated simulation software for the development of personalized cancer therapeutics, and (iv) translational attempts to pipeline multi-scale panomics data for data-driven in silico clinical oncology. The review concludes that the absence of a generic, zero-code, panomics-based multi-scale modeling pipeline and associated software framework, impedes the development and seamless deployment of personalized in silico multi-scale models in clinical settings.

  abstract={Purpose: Due to the increasing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, and to improve quality and efficiency of care, there is a need for adequate and efficient clinical decision-making. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has resulted in the development of prediction models, which might aid clinical decision-making. This systematic review seeks to give a contemporary overview of the current maturity of AI in the ICU, the research methods behind these studies, and the risk of bias in these studies. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify eligible studies. Studies using AI to analyze ICU data were considered eligible. Specifically, the study design, study aim, dataset size, level of validation, level of readiness, and the outcomes of clinical trials were extracted. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Results: Out of 6455 studies identified through literature search, 494 were included. The most common study design was retrospective [476 studies (96.4% of all studies)] followed by prospective observational [8 (1.6%)] and clinical [10 (2%)] trials. 378 (80.9%) retrospective studies were classified as high risk of bias. No studies were identified that reported on the outcome evaluation of an AI model integrated in routine clinical practice. Conclusion: The vast majority of developed ICU-AI models remain within the testing and prototyping environment; only a handful were actually evaluated in clinical practice. A uniform and structured approach can support the development, safe delivery, and implementation of AI to determine clinical benefit in the ICU. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={There is a growing interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to orthopaedic surgery. This review aims to identify and characterise research in this field, in order to understand the extent, range and nature of this work, and act as springboard to stimulate future studies. A scoping review, a form of structured evidence synthesis, was conducted to summarise the use of AI in orthopaedics. A literature search (1946-2019) identified 222 studies eligible for inclusion. These studies were predominantly small and retrospective. There has been significant growth in the number of papers published in the last three years, mainly from the USA (37%). The majority of research used AI for image interpretation (45%) or as a clinical decision tool (25%). Spine (43%), knee (23%) and hip (14%) were the regions of the body most commonly studied. The application of artificial intelligence to orthopaedics is growing. However, the scope of its use so far remains limited, both in terms of its possible clinical applications, and the sub-specialty areas of the body which have been studied. A standardized method of reporting AI studies would allow direct assessment and comparison. Prospective studies are required to validate AI tools for clinical use.  © 2021 Federer, Jones.

  abstract={Background. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an era upcoming in medicine and, more recently, in the operating room (OR). Existing literature elaborates mainly on the future possibilities and expectations for AI in surgery. The aim of this study is to systematically provide an overview of the current actual AI applications used to support processes inside the OR. Methods. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore were searched using inclusion criteria for relevant articles up to August 25th, 2020. No study types were excluded beforehand. Articles describing current AI applications for surgical purposes inside the OR were reviewed. Results. Nine studies were included. An overview of the researched and described applications of AI in the OR is provided, including procedure duration prediction, gesture recognition, intraoperative cancer detection, intraoperative video analysis, workflow recognition, an endoscopic guidance system, knot-tying, and automatic registration and tracking of the bone in orthopedic surgery. These technologies are compared to their, often non-AI, baseline alternatives. Conclusions. Currently described applications of AI in the OR are limited to date. They may, however, have a promising future in improving surgical precision, reduce manpower, support intraoperative decision-making, and increase surgical safety. Nonetheless, the application and implementation of AI inside the OR still has several challenges to overcome. Clear regulatory, organizational, and clinical conditions are imperative for AI to redeem its promise. Future research on use of AI in the OR should therefore focus on clinical validation of AI applications, the legal and ethical considerations, and on evaluation of implementation trajectory. © The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract={The echocardiogram is a test that is widely used in Heart Disease Diagnoses. However, its analysis is largely dependent on the physician's experience. In this regard, artificial intelligence has become an essential technology to assist physicians. This study is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of primary state-of-the-art studies that used Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to automate echocardiogram analyses. Searches on the leading scientific article indexing platforms using a search string returned approximately 1400 articles. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 118 articles were selected to compose the detailed SLR. This SLR presents a thorough investigation of AI applied to support medical decisions for the main types of echocardiogram (Transthoracic, Transesophageal, Doppler, Stress, and Fetal). The article's data extraction indicated that the primary research interest of the studies comprised four groups: 1) Improvement of image quality; 2) identification of the cardiac window vision plane; 3) quantification and analysis of cardiac functions, and; 4) detection and classification of cardiac diseases. The articles were categorized and grouped to show the main contributions of the literature to each type of ECHO. The results indicate that the Deep Learning (DL) methods presented the best results for the detection and segmentation of the heart walls, right and left atrium and ventricles, and classification of heart diseases using images/videos obtained by echocardiography. The models that used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its variations showed the best results for all groups. The evidence produced by the results presented in the tabulation of the studies indicates that the DL contributed significantly to advances in echocardiogram automated analysis processes. Although several solutions were presented regarding the automated analysis of ECHO, this area of research still has great potential for further studies to improve the accuracy of results already known in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), methodologies can inform patient care during pregnancy and improve outcomes. Materials and methods: We searched English articles on EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Search terms included ML, AI, pregnancy and informatics. We included research articles and book chapters, excluding conference papers, editorials and notes. Results: We identified 127 distinct studies from our queries that were relevant to our topic and included in the review. We found that supervised learning methods were more popular (n = 69) than unsupervised methods (n = 9). Popular methods included support vector machines (n = 30), artificial neural networks (n = 22), regression analysis (n = 17) and random forests (n = 16). Methods such as DL are beginning to gain traction (n = 13). Common areas within the pregnancy domain where AI and ML methods were used the most include prenatal care (e.g. fetal anomalies, placental functioning) (n = 73); perinatal care, birth and delivery (n = 20); and preterm birth (n = 13). Efforts to translate AI into clinical care include clinical decision support systems (n = 24) and mobile health applications (n = 9). Conclusions: Overall, we found that ML and AI methods are being employed to optimize pregnancy outcomes, including modern DL methods (n = 13). Future research should focus on less-studied pregnancy domain areas, including postnatal and postpartum care (n = 2). Also, more work on clinical adoption of AI methods and the ethical implications of such adoption is needed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease that attacks the brain's neurons and causes problems in memory, thinking, and reasoning skills. Personalized Medicine (PM) needs a better and more accurate understanding of the relationship between human genetic data and complex diseases like AD. The goal of PM is to tailor the treatment of a case person to his individual properties. PM requires the prediction of a person's disease from genetic data, and its success depends on the accurate detection of genetic biomarkers. Single Nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered the most prevalent type of variation in the human genome. Epistasis has a biological relevance to complex diseases and has an important impact on PM. Detection of the most significant epistasis interactions associated with complex diseases is a big challenge. This paper reviews several machine learning techniques and algorithms to detect the most significant epistasis interactions in Alzheimer's disease. We discuss many machine learning techniques that can be used for detecting SNPs' combinations like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction, Neural Network, and Deep Learning. This review paper highlights the pros and cons of these techniques and explains how they can be applied in an efficient framework to apply knowledge discovery and data mining in AD disease.  © 2021 National Taiwan University.},

  abstract={Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and cardiovascular disease burden is increasing in low-resource settings and for lower socioeconomic groups. Machine learning algorithms are being developed rapidly and incorporated into clinical practice for cardiovascular disease prediction and treatment decisions. Significant opportunities for reducing death and disability from cardiovascular disease worldwide lie with accounting for the social determinants of cardiovascular outcomes. This study reviews how social determinants of health are being included in machine learning algorithms to inform best practices for the development of algorithms that account for social determinants. Methods: A systematic review using 5 databases was conducted in 2020. English language articles from any location published from inception to April 10, 2020, which reported on the use of machine learning for cardiovascular disease prediction that incorporated social determinants of health, were included. Results: Most studies that compared machine learning algorithms and regression showed increased performance of machine learning, and most studies that compared performance with or without social determinants of health showed increased performance with them. The most frequently included social determinants of health variables were gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, occupation, and income. Studies were largely from North America, Europe, and China, limiting the diversity of the included populations and variance in social determinants of health. Discussion: Given their flexibility, machine learning approaches may provide an opportunity to incorporate the complex nature of social determinants of health. The limited variety of sources and data in the reviewed studies emphasize that there is an opportunity to include more social determinants of health variables, especially environmental ones, that are known to impact cardiovascular disease risk and that recording such data in electronic databases will enable their use. © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

  abstract={Radiomics supposes an alternative non-invasive tumor characterization tool, which has experienced increased interest with the advent of more powerful computers and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Nonetheless, the incorporation of radiomics in cancer clinical-decision support systems still necessitates a thorough analysis of its relationship with tumor biology. Herein, we present a systematic review focusing on the clinical evidence of radiomics as a surrogate method for tumor molecular profile characterization. An extensive literature review was conducted in PubMed, including papers on radiomics and a selected set of clinically relevant and commonly used tumor molecular markers. We summarized our findings based on different cancer entities, additionally evaluating the effect of different modalities for the prediction of biomarkers at each tumor site. Results suggest the existence of an association between the studied biomarkers and radiomics from different modalities and different tumor sites, even though a larger number of multi-center studies are required to further validate the reported outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Introduction: The use of machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare encompasses an emerging concept that envisages vast contributions to the tackling of rare diseases. In this scenario, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves complexities that are yet not demystified. In ALS, the biomedical signals present themselves as potential biomarkers that, when used in tandem with smart algorithms, can be useful to applications within the context of the disease. Methods: This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) consists of searching for and investigating primary studies that use ML techniques and biomedical signals related to ALS. Following the definition and execution of the SLR protocol, 18 articles met the inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria, and answered the SLR research questions. Discussions: Based on the results, we identified three classes of ML applications combined with biomedical signals in the context of ALS: diagnosis (72.22%), communication (22.22%), and survival prediction (5.56%). Conclusions: Distinct algorithmic models and biomedical signals have been reported and present promising approaches, regardless of their classes. In summary, this SLR provides an overview of the primary studies analyzed as well as directions for the construction and evolution of technology-based research within the scope of ALS. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence (AI) not only yields in advantages for healthcare but raises several ethical questions. Extant research on ethical considerations of AI in digital health is quite sparse and a holistic overview is lacking. A systematic literature review searching across 853 peer-reviewed journals and conferences yielded in 50 relevant articles categorized in five major ethical principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. The ethical landscape of AI in digital health is portrayed including a snapshot guiding future development. The status quo highlights potential areas with little empirical but required research. Less explored areas with remaining ethical questions are validated and guide scholars’ efforts by outlining an overview of addressed ethical principles and intensity of studies including correlations. Practitioners understand novel questions AI raises eventually leading to properly regulated implementations and further comprehend that society is on its way from supporting technologies to autonomous decision-making systems. © The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) modeling in hip and knee arthroplasty (total joint arthroplasty [TJA]) is becoming more commonplace. This systematic review aims to quantify the accuracy of current AI- and ML-based application for cognitive support and decision-making in TJA. Methods: A comprehensive search of publications was conducted through the EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed databases using relevant keywords to maximize the sensitivity of the search. No limits were placed on level of evidence or timing of the study. Findings were reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Analysis of variance testing with post-hoc Tukey test was applied to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of the models. Results: After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 49 studies were included in this review. The application of AI/ML-based models and average AUC is as follows: cost prediction-0.77, LOS and discharges-0.78, readmissions and reoperations-0.66, preoperative patient selection/planning-0.79, adverse events and other postoperative complications-0.84, postoperative pain-0.83, postoperative patient-reported outcomes measures and functional outcome-0.81. Significant variability in model AUC across the different decision support applications was found (P <.001) with the AUC for readmission and reoperation models being significantly lower than that of the other decision support categories. Conclusions: AI/ML-based applications in TJA continue to expand and have the potential to optimize patient selection and accurately predict postoperative outcomes, complications, and associated costs. On average, the AI/ML models performed best in predicting postoperative complications, pain, and patient-reported outcomes and were less accurate in predicting hospital readmissions and reoperations. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={Objectives The purpose of this scoping review is to: (1) identify existing supervised machine learning (ML) approaches on the prediction of cancer in asymptomatic adults; (2) to compare the performance of ML models with each other and (3) to identify potential gaps in research. Design Scoping review using the population, concept and context approach. Search strategy PubMed search engine was used from inception to 10 November 2020 to identify literature meeting following inclusion criteria: (1) a general adult (≥18 years) population, either sex, asymptomatic (population); (2) any study using ML techniques to derive predictive models for future cancer risk using clinical and/or demographic and/or basic laboratory data (concept) and (3) original research articles conducted in all settings in any region of the world (context). Results The search returned 627 unique articles, of which 580 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, were duplicates or were related to benign neoplasm. Full-text reviews were conducted for 47 articles and a final set of 10 articles were included in this scoping review. These 10 very heterogeneous studies used ML to predict future cancer risk in asymptomatic individuals. All studies reported area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values as metrics of model performance, but no study reported measures of model calibration. Conclusions Research gaps that must be addressed in order to deliver validated ML-based models to assist clinical decision-making include: (1) establishing model generalisability through validation in independent cohorts, including those from low-income and middle-income countries; (2) establishing models for all cancer types; (3) thorough comparisons of ML models with best available clinical tools to ensure transparency of their potential clinical utility; (4) reporting of model calibration performance and (5) comparisons of different methods on the same cohort to reveal important information about model generalisability and performance. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

  abstract={Food is an important determinant of health, featuring prominently in the Sustainable Development Goals. The term “big data” is seldom used in relation to food, partly because food data are scattered across different sectors. The increasing availability of food-related data presents an opportunity to glean new insights on food and food systems. These insights may enhance the quality of products and services and improve decision-making on optimizing food availability, all to the end of producing better health. Yet, knowledge gaps remain about the unique opportunities and challenges linked to big data on food and their use in decision-making. This scoping review explored the available literature linking food with big data and decision-making, using the following research question: What is the current literature on data about food, and how are these data used in decision-making? We searched PubMed until 29 February 2020 and Embase, Web of Sciences, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until 8 March 2020. We included studies written in English and conducted narrative analyses to identify relevant themes from included studies. Sixteen studies fulfilled our eligibility criteria, including big data analyses, modelling studies, and reviews. These studies described the added value of using big data and how evidence from big data had or can be used for decision-making, as well as challenges and opportunities for such use. The majority of the included studies examined the link between food and big data, while hypothesizing of how these insights could inform decision-making, including policies, interventions, programs, and financing. There were only two examples wherein big data on food informed decision-making directly. The review highlights several false dichotomies in how the subject is approached in the literature and the importance of context, both between and within countries, in shaping the availability and types of data that can be used as meaningful evidence to inform decision-making. This review shows the paucity of research around the intersection of food, big data, and decision-making, as well as the potential in using big data on food systems to the end of informing decisions to improve the health of populations. Future research and decision-making around health systems can benefit from examining the full spectrum of perspectives on the subject. Future research and decision-making around health systems can also employ the steadfast embrace of technology, which will potentially reduce disparities in big data availability, to the end of improving the health of populations. © 2021, The New York Academy of Medicine.},

  abstract={Five thousand six hundred ten scientific articles related to Learning Analytics (LA) are stored in Scopus and Web of Science from 2014 until 2019, as evidence of the importance and increasing interest in this new line of research. LA is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs. LA is widely used in universities; Ecuador has three hundred forty-five Higher Educational Institutions. One of the reasons why research in the area of LA does not increase is the lack of a baseline (cutting edge information that provides starting points for researching and publishing). This research discovers and analyses scientific documents in LA and answers the central question: What is the baseline of scientific documents on LA in Ecuador? The methodology used was a Systematic Review (SR) to answer eight research questions about scientific articles and theses in LA by Ecuadorian authors. The study presented in this paper was carried out from 2014 to June 2019; ninety-nine scientific documents about LA were found in Scopus, WOS, IEEE, RRAAE and Senescyt. Sixty-one scientific documents were downloaded, arranged and analyzed using Statistical Implicative Analysis (SIA) after removing duplicates, applying inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria. SIA was proposed by Regis Gras and discovers rules between variables and represents them through dendrograms. SR together with SIA was used for the first time in this paper. The built baseline will allow learning more about LA in Ecuador and increasing research and publications. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The current method of defining, reporting, assessment, labeling, delabeling, and reconciliation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and specifically immunologically mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), in electronic health records (EHRs) is inadequate and compromises care quality and safety. It is critical to accurately and succinctly report the signs and symptoms associated with ADRs and suspected HSRs to enable clinicians to determine the plausible reaction type and help guide appropriate future management plans. Despite the current limitations of the EHR allergy module, we must encourage improved clinical documentation and demand technological improvements. Telehealth methods have been shown to be valuable in the assessment of ADRs and HSRs, particularly in the case of penicillin allergy evaluation and delabeling. The implementation, assessment, and refinement of advanced technologies, including clinical informatics and artificial intelligence, along with continued education of health care providers have potential to improve EHR documentation and communication, thereby advancing patient safety efforts. © 2021 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology},

  abstract={Background: Fuzzy logic can be used to model and manipulate imprecise and subjective knowledge imitating the human reasoning. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to analyze research studies pertaining to fuzzy logic and fuzzy intelligent systems applications in midwifery and obstetrics. Methods: A thorough literature review was performed in four electronic databases (PubMed, APA PsycINFO, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect). Only the papers that discussed fuzzy logic and fuzzy intelligent systems applications in midwifery and obstetrics were considered in this review. Selected papers were critically evaluated as for their relevance and a contextual synthesis was conducted. Results: Twentynine papers were included in this systematic review as they met the inclusion and methodological criteria specified in this study. The results suggest that fuzzy logic and fuzzy intelligent systems have been successfully applied in midwifery and obstetrics topics, such as diagnosis, pregnancy risk assessment, fetal monitoring, bladder tumor, etc. Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that fuzzy logic is applicable to midwifery and obstetrics domains providing the means for developing affective intelligent systems that can assist human experts in dealing with complex diagnosis and problem solving. However, its full potential is not yet been examined, thus presenting an opportunity for further research. © 2021 Stavroula G Barbounaki, Antigoni Sarantaki, Kleanthi Gourounti},

  abstract={Purpose: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed through observation or interview assessments, which is time-consuming, subjective, and with questionable validity and reliability. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the role of machine learning (ML) with neuroimaging data to provide a reliable classification of ASD. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase was conducted to identify relevant publications. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the studies’ quality. A bivariate random-effects model meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the pooled sensitivity, the pooled specificity, and the diagnostic performance through the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve of ML with neuroimaging data in classifying ASD. Meta-regression was also performed. Results: Forty-four studies (5697 ASD and 6013 typically developing individuals [TD] in total) were included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled sensitivity for differentiating ASD from TD individuals was 86.25 95% confidence interval [CI] (81.24, 90.08), while the pooled specificity was 83.31 95% CI (78.12, 87.48) with a combined area under the HSROC (AUC) of 0.889. Higgins I2 (> 90%) and Cochran’s Q (p < 0.0001) suggest a high degree of heterogeneity. In the bivariate model meta-regression, a higher pooled specificity was observed in studies not using a brain atlas (90.91 95% CI [80.67, 96.00], p = 0.032). In addition, a greater pooled sensitivity was seen in studies recruiting both males and females (89.04 95% CI [83.84, 92.72], p = 0.021), and combining imaging modalities (94.12 95% [85.43, 97.76], p = 0.036). Conclusion: ML with neuroimaging data is an exciting prospect in detecting individuals with ASD but further studies are required to improve its reliability for usage in clinical practice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Objective: Given widespread excitement around predictive analytics and the proliferation of machine learning algorithms that predict outcomes, a key next step is understanding how this information is - or should be - communicated with patients. Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping review informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify current knowledge and gaps in this domain. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria for full text review. The following topics were represented in the studies, some of which involved more than 1 topic: disease prevention (N = 5/10, 50%), treatment decisions (N = 5/10, 50%), medication harms reduction (N = 1/10, 10%), and presentation of cardiovascular risk information (N = 5/10, 50%). A single study included 6- and 12-month clinical outcome metrics. Discussion: As predictive models are increasingly published, marketed by industry, and implemented, this paucity of relevant research poses important gaps. Published studies identified the importance of (1) identifying the most effective source of information for patient communications; (2) contextualizing risk information and associated design elements based on users' needs and problem areas; and (3) understanding potential impacts on risk factor modification and behavior change dependent on risk presentation. Conclusion: An opportunity remains for researchers and practitioners to share strategies for effective selection of predictive algorithms for clinical practice, approaches for educating clinicians and patients in effectively using predictive data, and new approaches for framing patient-provider communication in the era of artificial intelligence.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: The number of smartphone apps that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of depression is increasing. A promising approach to increase the effectiveness of the apps while reducing the individual’s burden is the use of just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) mechanisms. JITAIs are designed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention and reduce the burden on the person using the intervention by providing the right type of support at the right time. The right type of support and the right time are determined by measuring the state of vulnerability and the state of receptivity, respectively. Objective: The aim of this study is to systematically assess the use of JITAI mechanisms in popular apps for individuals with depression. Methods: We systematically searched for apps addressing depression in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as in curated lists from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the United Kingdom National Health Service, and the American Psychological Association in August 2020. The relevant apps were ranked according to the number of reviews (Apple App Store) or downloads (Google Play Store). For each app, 2 authors separately reviewed all publications concerning the app found within scientific databases (PubMed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM Portal, and Science Direct), publications cited on the app’s website, information on the app’s website, and the app itself. All types of measurements (eg, open questions, closed questions, and device analytics) found in the apps were recorded and reviewed. Results: None of the 28 reviewed apps used JITAI mechanisms to tailor content to situations, states, or individuals. Of the 28 apps, 3 (11%) did not use any measurements, 20 (71%) exclusively used self-reports that were insufficient to leverage the full potential of the JITAIs, and the 5 (18%) apps using self-reports and passive measurements used them as progress or task indicators only. Although 34% (23/68) of the reviewed publications investigated the effectiveness of the apps and 21% (14/68) investigated their efficacy, no publication mentioned or evaluated JITAI mechanisms. Conclusions: Promising JITAI mechanisms have not yet been translated into mainstream depression apps. Although the wide range of passive measurements available from smartphones were rarely used, self-reported outcomes were used by 71% (20/28) of the apps. However, in both cases, the measured outcomes were not used to tailor content and timing along a state of vulnerability or receptivity. Owing to this lack of tailoring to individual, state, or situation, we argue that the apps cannot be considered JITAIs. The lack of publications investigating whether JITAI mechanisms lead to an increase in the effectiveness or efficacy of the apps highlights the need for further research, especially in real-world apps. ©Gisbert W Teepe, Ashish Da Fonseca, Birgit Kleim, Nicholas C Jacobson, Alicia Salamanca Sanabria, Lorainne Tudor Car, Elgar Fleisch, Tobias Kowatsch.},

  abstract={Objective: This systematic review sought to establish a picture of length of stay (LOS) prediction methods based on available hospital data and study protocols designed to measure their performance. Materials and Methods: An English literature search was done relative to hospital LOS prediction from 1972 to September 2019 according to the PRISMA guidelines. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and arXiv databases. Information were extracted from the included papers according to a standardized assessment of population setting and study sample, data sources and input variables, LOS prediction methods, validation study design, and performance evaluation metrics. Results: Among 74 selected articles, 98.6% (73/74) used patients' data to predict LOS; 27.0% (20/74) used temporal data; and 21.6% (16/74) used the data about hospitals. Overall, regressions were the most popular prediction methods (64.9%, 48/74), followed by machine learning (20.3%, 15/74) and deep learning (17.6%, 13/74). Regarding validation design, 35.1% (26/74) did not use a test set, whereas 47.3% (35/74) used a separate test set, and 17.6% (13/74) used cross-validation. The most used performance metrics were R 2(47.3%, 35/74), mean squared (or absolute) error (24.4%, 18/74), and the accuracy (14.9%, 11/74). Over the last decade, machine learning and deep learning methods became more popular (P=0.016), and test sets and cross-validation got more and more used (P=0.014). Conclusions: Methods to predict LOS are more and more elaborate and the assessment of their validity is increasingly rigorous. Reducing heterogeneity in how these methods are used and reported is key to transparency on their performance. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background: Bias-prone psychiatric interviews remain the mainstay of bipolar disorder (BD) assessment. The development of digital phenotyping promises to improve BD management. We present a systematic review of the evidence about the use of portable digital devices for the identification of BD, BD types and BD mood states and for symptom assessment. Methods: We searched Web of KnowledgeSM, Scopus ®, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases (until 5/1/2021) for articles evaluating the use of portable/wearable digital devices, such as smartphone apps, wearable sensors, audio and/or visual recordings, and multimodal tools. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020200086). Results: We included 62 studies (2325 BD; 724 healthy controls, HC): 27 using smartphone apps, either for recording self-assessments (n = 10) or for passively gathering metadata (n = 7) or both (n = 10); 15 using wearable sensors for physiological parameters; 17 analysing audio and/or video recordings; 3 using multiple technologies. Two thirds of the included studies applied artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches. They achieved fair to excellent classification performances. Limitations: The included studies had small sample sizes and marked heterogeneity. Evidence of overfitting emerged, limiting generalizability. The absence of clear guidelines about reporting classification performances, with no shared standard metrics, makes results hardly interpretable and comparable. Conclusions: New technologies offer a noteworthy opportunity to BD digital phenotyping with objectivity and high granularity. AI-based models could deliver important support in clinical decision-making. Further research and cooperation between different stakeholders are needed for addressing methodological, ethical and socio-economic considerations. © 2021},

  abstract={Background: Machine-learning algorithms and big data analytics, popularly known as ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI), are being developed and taken up globally. Patient and public involvement (PPI) in the transition to AI-assisted health care is essential for design justice based on diverse patient needs. Objective: To inform the future development of PPI in AI-assisted health care by exploring public engagement in the conceptualization, design, development, testing, implementation, use and evaluation of AI technologies for mental health. Methods: Systematic scoping review drawing on design justice principles, and (i) structured searches of Web of Science (all databases) and Ovid (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and Embase); (ii) handsearching (reference and citation tracking); (iii) grey literature; and (iv) inductive thematic analysis, tested at a workshop with health researchers. Results: The review identified 144 articles that met inclusion criteria. Three main themes reflect the challenges and opportunities associated with PPI in AI-assisted mental health care: (a) applications of AI technologies in mental health care; (b) ethics of public engagement in AI-assisted care; and (c) public engagement in the planning, development, implementation, evaluation and diffusion of AI technologies. Conclusion: The new data-rich health landscape creates multiple ethical issues and opportunities for the development of PPI in relation to AI technologies. Further research is needed to understand effective modes of public engagement in the context of AI technologies, to examine pressing ethical and safety issues and to develop new methods of PPI at every stage, from concept design to the final review of technology in practice. Principles of design justice can guide this agenda. © 2021 The Authors. Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Microbial pathogens have evolved numerous mechanisms to hijack host’s systems, thus causing disease. This is mediated by alterations in the combined host-pathogen proteome in time and space. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches have been developed and tailored to map disease progression. The result is complex multidimensional data that pose numerous analytic challenges for downstream interpretation. However, a systematic review of approaches for the downstream analysis of such data has been lacking in the field. In this review, we detail the steps of a typical temporal and spatial analysis, including data pre-processing steps (i.e., quality control, data normalization, the imputation of missing values, and dimensionality reduction), different statistical and machine learning approaches, validation, interpretation, and the extraction of biological information from mass spectrometry data. We also discuss current best practices for these steps based on a collection of independent studies to guide users in selecting the most suitable strategies for their dataset and analysis objectives. Moreover, we also compiled the list of commonly used R software packages for each step of the analysis. These could be easily integrated into one’s analysis pipeline. Furthermore, we guide readers through various analysis steps by applying these workflows to mock and host-pathogen interaction data from public datasets. The workflows presented in this review will serve as an introduction for data analysis novices, while also helping established users update their data analysis pipelines. We conclude the review by discussing future directions and developments in temporal and spatial proteomics and data analysis approaches. Data analysis codes, prepared for this review are available from https://github.com/BabuLab-UofR/TempSpac, where guidelines and sample datasets are also offered for testing purposes. © Copyright © 2021 Rahmatbakhsh, Gagarinova and Babu.},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used in addition to conventional statistical modelling (CSM) for predicting readmission and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). However, the two approaches have not been systematically compared across studies of prognosis in patients with MI. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature via Medline, EPub, Cochrane Central, Embase, Inspec, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science. Eligible studies included primary research articles published from January 2000 to March 2020, comparing ML and CSM for prognostication after MI. Results: Of 7,348 articles, 112 underwent full-text review, with the final set composed of 24 articles representing 374,365 patients. ML methods included artificial neural networks (n = 12 studies), random forests (n = 11), decision trees (n = 8), support vector machines (n = 8), and Bayesian techniques (n = 7). CSM included logistic regression (n = 19 studies), existing CSM-derived risk scores (n = 12), and Cox regression (n = 2). Thirteen of 19 studies examining mortality reported higher C-indexes with the use of ML compared with CSM. One study examined readmissions at 2 different time points, with C-indexes that were higher for ML than CSM. Across all studies, a total of 29 comparisons were performed, but the majority (n = 26, 90%) found small (< 0.05) absolute differences in the C-index between ML and CSM. With the use of a modified CHARMS checklist, sources of bias were identifiable in the majority of studies, and only 2 were externally validated. Conclusion: Although ML algorithms tended to have higher C-indexes than CSM for predicting death or readmission after MI, these studies exhibited threats to internal validity and were often unvalidated. Further comparisons are needed, with adherence to clinical quality standards for prognosis research. (Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42019134896) © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society},

  abstract={Introduction: Annually, hydrocephalus affects nearly 7 children per 10,000 live births around the world. It significantly impairs the quality of life of such children and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality The high cost of treatment and post-intervention complications add to the burden of disease. Deployment of machine learning (ML) models in actual clinical settings have led to improved outcomes. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the utility as well as acknowledge the achievements of AI/ML in HCP decision making. Methodology: PubMed and Cochrane databases were used to perform a systematic search with proper terminology to include all the relevant articles up to May 2021. Results: Fifteen studies that described the use of ML models in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of pediatric hydrocephalus were identified. The median accuracy of prediction by the ML model in various tasks listed above was found to be 0.88. ML models were most commonly employed for ventricular segmentation for diagnosis of hydrocephalus. The most frequently used model was neural networks. ML models attained faster processing speeds than their manual and non-ML-based automated counterparts. Conclusion: This study attempts to evaluate the important advances and applications of ML in pediatric hydrocephalus. These methods may be better suited for clinical use than manual methods alone due to faster automated processing and near-human accuracy. Future studies should evaluate whether the use of these models is feasible in the future for patient care and management in field settings. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

  abstract={Online learning represents a family of machine learning methods, where a learner attempts to tackle some predictive (or any type of decision-making) task by learning from a sequence of data instances one by one at each time. The goal of online learning is to maximize the accuracy/correctness for the sequence of predictions/decisions made by the online learner given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction/learning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to traditional batch or offline machine learning methods that are often designed to learn a model from the entire training data set at once. Online learning has become a promising technique for learning from continuous streams of data in many real-world applications. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the online machine learning literature through a systematic review of basic ideas and key principles and a proper categorization of different algorithms and techniques. Generally speaking, according to the types of learning tasks and the forms of feedback information, the existing online learning works can be classified into three major categories: (i) online supervised learning where full feedback information is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback, and (iii) online unsupervised learning where no feedback is available. Due to space limitation, the survey will be mainly focused on the first category, but also briefly cover some basics of the other two categories. Finally, we also discuss some open issues and attempt to shed light on potential future research directions in this field. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background: The ubiquity of mobile devices has made it possible for clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) to become available to healthcare providers on handheld devices at the point-of-care, including in low- and middle-income countries. The use of CDSS by providers can potentially improve adherence to treatment protocols and patient outcomes. However, the evidence on the effect of the use of CDSS on mobile devices needs to be synthesized. This review was carried out to support a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline that aimed to inform investments on the use of decision-support tools on digital devices to strengthen primary healthcare. Objectives: To assess the effects of digital clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) accessible via mobile devices by primary healthcare providers in the context of primary care settings. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index Medicus, POPLINE, and two trial registries from 1 January 2000 to 9 October 2020. We conducted a grey literature search using mHealthevidence.org and issued a call for papers through popular digital health communities of practice. Finally, we conducted citation searches of included studies. Selection criteria: Study design: we included randomized trials, including full-text studies, conference abstracts, and unpublished data irrespective of publication status or language of publication. Types of participants: we included studies of all cadres of healthcare providers, including lay health workers and other individuals (administrative, managerial, and supervisory staff) involved in the delivery of primary healthcare services using clinical decision-support tools; and studies of clients or patients receiving care from primary healthcare providers using digital decision-support tools. Types of interventions: we included studies comparing digital CDSS accessible via mobile devices with non-digital CDSS or no intervention, in the context of primary care. CDSS could include clinical protocols, checklists, and other job-aids which supported risk prioritization of patients. Mobile devices included mobile phones of any type (but not analogue landline telephones), as well as tablets, personal digital assistants, and smartphones. We excluded studies where digital CDSS were used on laptops or integrated with electronic medical records or other types of longitudinal tracking of clients. Data collection and analysis: A machine learning classifier that gave each record a probability score of being a randomized trial screened all search results. Two review authors screened titles and abstracts of studies with more than 10% probability of being a randomized trial, and one review author screened those with less than 10% probability of being a randomized trial. We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for the most important outcomes. Main results: Eight randomized trials across varying healthcare contexts in the USA,. India, China, Guatemala, Ghana, and Kenya, met our inclusion criteria. A range of healthcare providers (facility and community-based, formally trained, and lay workers) used digital CDSS. Care was provided for the management of specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal risk assessment, and maternal and child health. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, and we often downgraded evidence for risk of bias and imprecision. We are uncertain of the effect of this intervention on providers' adherence to recommended practice due to the very low certainty evidence (2 studies, 185 participants). The effect of the intervention on patients' and clients' health behaviours such as smoking and treatment adherence is mixed, with substantial variation across outcomes for similar types of behaviour (2 studies, 2262 participants). The intervention probably makes little or no difference to smoking rates among people at risk of cardiovascular disease but probably increases other types of desired behaviour among patients, such as adherence to treatment. The effect of the intervention on patients'/clients' health status and well-being is also mixed (5 studies, 69,767 participants). It probably makes little or no difference to some types of health outcomes, but we are uncertain about other health outcomes, including maternal and neonatal deaths, due to very low-certainty evidence. The intervention may slightly improve patient or client acceptability and satisfaction (1 study, 187 participants). We found no studies that reported the time between the presentation of an illness and appropriate management, provider acceptability or satisfaction, resource use, or unintended consequences. Authors' conclusions: We are uncertain about the effectiveness of mobile phone-based decision-support tools on several outcomes, including adherence to recommended practice. None of the studies had a quality of care framework and focused only on specific health areas. We need well-designed research that takes a systems lens to assess these issues.

  abstract={Purpose: To review the evidence on the relative prognostic performance of the available prognostic scores for survival in spinal metastatic surgery in order to provide a recommendation for use in clinical practice. Methods: A systematic review of comparative external validation studies assessing the performance of prognostic scores for survival in independent cohorts was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through Medline and Embase until May 2021. Studies were included when they compared at least four survival scoring systems in surgical or mixed cohorts across all primary tumor types. Predictive performance was assessed based on discrimination and calibration for 3-month, 1-year and overall survival, and generalizability was assessed based on the characteristics of the development cohort and external validation cohorts. Risk of bias and concern regarding applicability were assessed based on the ‘Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool’ (PROBAST). Results: Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and covered 17 scoring systems across 5.130 patients. Several scores suffer from suboptimal development and validation. The SORG Nomogram, developed in a large surgical cohort, showed good discrimination on 3-month and 1-year survival, good calibration and was superior in direct comparison with low risk of bias and low concern regarding applicability. Machine learning algorithms are promising as they perform equally well in direct comparison. Tokuhashi, Tomita and other traditional risk scores showed suboptimal performance. Conclusion: The SORG Nomogram and machine learning algorithms outline superior performance in survival prediction for surgery in spinal metastases. Further improvement by comparative validation in large multicenter, prospective cohorts can still be obtained. Given the heterogeneity of spinal metastases, superior methodology of development and validation is key in improving future machine learning systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of the deployment of digital detection surveillance systems to support early warning and monitoring of infectious diseases. These opportunities create a "double-edge sword," as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements. Objective: The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: In a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework. Results: This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights. Conclusions: Our findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers involved in the use of digital surveillance for infectious disease spread, and provide a basis for a global governance structure. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization of glioma has implications for prognosis, treatment planning, and prediction of treatment response. Current histopathology is limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and variability in detection methods. Advances in computational techniques have led to interest in mining quantitative imaging features to noninvasively detect genetic mutations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) models in molecular subtyping gliomas on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A systematic search was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines to identify studies up to April 1, 2020. Methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2. Diagnostic performance estimates were obtained using a bivariate model and heterogeneity was explored using metaregression. RESULTS: Forty-four original articles were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation in training datasets were 0.88 (95% CI 0.83-0.91) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.91), respectively, and 0.83 to 0.85 in validation sets. Use of data augmentation and MRI sequence type were weakly associated with heterogeneity. Both O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation and 1p/19q codeletion could be predicted with a pooled sensitivity and specificity between 0.76 and 0.83 in training datasets. CONCLUSION: ML application to preoperative MRI demonstrated promising results for predicting IDH mutation, MGMT methylation, and 1p/19q codeletion in glioma. Optimized ML models could lead to a noninvasive, objective tool that captures molecular information important for clinical decision making. Future studies should use multicenter data, external validation and investigate clinical feasibility of ML models.  © 2021 Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021.},

Many studies have been conducted that applied big data analytics in HES; however, a systematic review (SR) of the research is scarce. In this paper, the authors conducted a systematic mapping study to address this deficiency. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the mapping study resulted in highlighting the research progression over the last decade, and identification of three major themes, 12 subthemes, 10 motivation factors, 10 major challenges, three categories of tools and support techniques, and 16 models for applying big data analytics in higher education. This result contributes to the ongoing research on applying big data analytics in HES. It provides a better understanding of the level of contribution to research as well as identifies gaps for future research direction. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Objective The change in performance of machine learning models over time as a result of temporal dataset shift is a barrier to machine learning-derived models facilitating decision-making in clinical practice. Our aim was to describe technical procedures used to preserve the performance of machine learning models in the presence of temporal dataset shifts. Methods Studies were included if they were fully published articles that used machine learning and implemented a procedure to mitigate the effects of temporal dataset shift in a clinical setting. We described how dataset shift was measured, the procedures used to preserve model performance, and their effects. Results Of 4,457 potentially relevant publications identified, 15 were included. The impact of temporal dataset shift was primarily quantified using changes, usually deterioration, in calibration or discrimination. Calibration deterioration was more common (n = 11) than discrimination deterioration (n = 3). Mitigation strategies were categorized as model level or feature level. Model-level approaches (n = 15) were more common than feature-level approaches (n = 2), with the most common approaches being model refitting (n = 12), probability calibration (n = 7), model updating (n = 6), and model selection (n = 6). In general, all mitigation strategies were successful at preserving calibration but not uniformly successful in preserving discrimination. Conclusion There was limited research in preserving the performance of machine learning models in the presence of temporal dataset shift in clinical medicine. Future research could focus on the impact of dataset shift on clinical decision making, benchmark the mitigation strategies on a wider range of datasets and tasks, and identify optimal strategies for specific settings. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has invaded our daily lives, and in the last decade, there have been very promising applications of AI in the field of medicine, including medical imaging, in vitro diagnosis, intelligent rehabilitation, and prognosis. Breast cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in women and seriously threatens women’s physical and mental health. Early screening for breast cancer via mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly improve the prognosis of patients. AI has shown excellent performance in image recognition tasks and has been widely studied in breast cancer screening. This paper introduces the background of AI and its application in breast medical imaging (mammography, ultrasound and MRI), such as in the identification, segmentation and classification of lesions; breast density assessment; and breast cancer risk assessment. In addition, we also discuss the challenges and future perspectives of the application of AI in medical imaging of the breast. © Copyright © 2021 Lei, Yin, Yu, Yu, Zeng, Lv, Li, Ye, Cui and Dietrich.},

  abstract={Big Data has real value when the veracity of the collected data has been previously identified. However, data veracity for load monitoring in professional soccer players has not been analyzed yet. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence from the scientific literature related to data veracity for load monitoring in professional soccer. Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted for reports onthe data veracity of diverse load monitoring tools and the associated parameters used in professional soccer. Ninety-four studies were finally included in the review, with 39 different tools used and 578 associated parameters identified. The pooled sample consisted of 2066 footballers (95% male: 24 ± 3 years and 5% female: 24 ± 1 years). Seventy-three percent of these studies did not report veracity metrics for anyof the parameters from these tools. Thus, data veracity was found for 54% of tools and 23% of parameters. The current information will assist in the selection of the most appropriate tools and parameters to be used for load monitoring with traditional and Big Data approaches while identifying those still requiring the analysis of their veracity metrics or their improvement to acceptable veracity levels. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: Dengue modeling is a research topic that has increased in recent years. Early prediction and decision-making are key factors to control dengue. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyzes three modeling approaches of dengue: diagnostic, epidemic, intervention. These approaches require models of prediction, prescription and optimization. This SLR establishes the state-of-the-art in dengue modeling, using machine learning, in the last years. Methods: Several databases were selected to search the articles. The selection was made based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Sixty-four articles were obtained and analyzed to describe their strengths and limitations. Finally, challenges and opportunities for research on machine-learning for dengue modeling were identified. Results: Logistic regression was the most used modeling approach for the diagnosis of dengue (59.1%). The analysis of the epidemic approach showed that linear regression (17.4%) is the most used technique within the spatial analysis. Finally, the most used intervention modeling is General Linear Model with 70%. Conclusions: We conclude that cause-effect models may improve diagnosis and understanding of dengue. Models that manage uncertainty can also be helpful, because of low data-quality in healthcare. Finally, decentralization of data, using federated learning, may decrease computational costs and allow model building without compromising data security. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) systems have demonstrated their potential to enhance decision making; however, the linkage between BI&A and decision support systems (DSS) has been contested by some, if not completely denied by others. In this research, we investigate the foundations of BI&A by using foundational literature on DSS to open the ‘black box’ of BI&A systems. We argue that BI&A is fundamentally a subfield of DSS that is seeking to convert more data into deeper insight, but it has lost its connection to DSS literature and, thereby, missed research opportunities. In this paper, we first define DSS and BI&A and then present a systematic review of foundational DSS literature to assess their leveraging in BI&A research. By classifying cited DSS articles and citing BI&A articles into four areas: conceptual framework, design & implementation, business value & organizational use, and cognition & decision making, potential research for BI&A is uncovered. We reconcile these two research streams by mapping BI&A frameworks to classical DSS components through interviews with practitioners. The result is formulated as a comparative, process-level architecture for converting data into insight. New research opportunities for BI&A are suggested motivated by foundational DSS literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: Conventional predictive models are based on a combination of clinical and neuroimaging parameters using traditional statistical approaches. Emerging studies have shown that the machine learning (ML) prediction models with multiple pretreatment clinical variables have the potential to accurately prognosticate the outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing thrombectomy, and hence identify patients suitable for thrombectomy. This article summarizes the published studies on ML models in large vessel occlusion AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy. Methods: We searched electronic databases including PubMed from 1 January 2000 up to 14 October 2019 for studies that evaluated ML algorithms for the prediction of outcomes in stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy. We then used random-effects bivariate meta-analysis models to summarize the studies. Results: We retained a total of five studies that evaluated ML (4 support vector machine, 1 decision tree model) with a combined cohort of 802 patients. The prevalence of good functional outcome defined by 90-day mRS of 0–2 when available. Random effects model demonstrated that the AUC was 0.846 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.686–0.902). A pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 12.6 was computed. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.795 (95% CI 0.651–0.889) and 0.780 (95% CI 0.634–0.879), respectively. Conclusion: ML may be useful as an adjunct to clinical assessment to predict functional outcomes in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, and hence identify suitable patients for treatment. Further studies validating ML models in large multicenter cohorts are necessary to explore this further. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

This review uses the lens of visual analytics to examine four dimensions of visual representations for analysing collaborative discourse: goals, data sources, visualisation designs, and analytical techniques based on 89 studies. We found visual analysis approaches to be suitable and advantageous for decomposing the temporality of collaborative discourse. However, it has been challenging for current research to simultaneously consider learning theories and follow visualisation design principles when adopting visualisations to analyse collaborative discourse. At the same time, existing visual analysis approaches have mainly targeted learners or researchers in online contexts and mainly focused on mirroring collaborative discourse rather than providing advanced affordances such as alerting or advising. Informed by these findings, we propose a possible future research agenda and offer suggestions for the features of successful collaboration to guide the design of advanced affordances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Delirium remains a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and economic burden to society. “Big data” refers to data of significantly large volume, obtained from a variety of resources, which is created and processed at high velocity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring whether big data could predict the incidence of delirium of patients in the inpatient setting. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, clinicaltrials.gov, who.int and IEEE Xplore were searched using MeSH terms “big data”, “data mining”, “delirium” and “confusion” up to 30th September 2019. We included both randomised and observational studies. The primary outcome of interest was development of delirium and the secondary outcomes of interest were type of statistical methods used, variables included in the mining algorithms and clinically important outcomes such as mortality and length of hospital stay. The quality of studies was graded using the CHARMs checklist. Six retrospective single centre observational studies were included (n = 178,091), of which 17, 574 participants developed delirium. Studies were of generally of low to moderate quality. The most commonly studied method was random forest, followed by support vector machine and artificial neural networks. The model with best performance for delirium prediction was random forest, with area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) ranging from 0.78 to 0.91. Sensitivity ranged from 0.59 to 0.81 and specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.92. Our systematic review suggests that machine-learning techniques can be utilised to predict delirium. © 2021},

  abstract={In vitro fertilization has been regarded as a forefront solution in treating infertility for over four decades, yet its effectiveness has remained relatively low. This could be attributed to the lack of advancements for the method of observing and selecting the most viable embryos for implantation. The conventional morphological assessment of embryos exhibits inevitable drawbacks which include time- and effort-consuming, and imminent risks of bias associated with subjective assessments performed by individual embryologists. A combination of these disadvantages, undeterred by the introduction of the time-lapse incubator technology, has been considered as a prominent contributor to the less preferable success rate of IVF cycles. Nonetheless, a recent surge of AI-based solutions for tasks automation in IVF has been observed. An AI-powered assistant could improve the efficiency of performing certain tasks in addition to offering accurate algorithms that behave as baselines to minimize the subjectivity of the decision-making process. Through a comprehensive review, we have discovered multiple approaches of implementing deep learning technology, each with varying degrees of success, for constructing the automated systems in IVF which could evaluate and even annotate the developmental stages of an embryo. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Gait dysfunction or impairment is considered one of the most common and devastating physiological consequences of stroke, and achieving optimal gait is a key goal for stroke victims with gait disability along with their clinical teams. Many researchers have explored post stroke gait, including assessment tools and techniques, key gait parameters and significance on functional recovery, as well as data mining, modeling and analyses methods. Research Question: This study aimed to review and summarize research efforts applicable to quantification and analyses of post-stroke gait with focus on recent technology-driven gait characterization and analysis approaches, including the integration of smart low cost wearables and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as feasibility and potential value in clinical settings. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted within Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect using a set of keywords, including lower extremity, walking, post-stroke, and kinematics. Original articles that met the selection criteria were included. Results and Significance: This scoping review aimed to shed light on tools and technologies employed in post stroke gait assessment toward bridging the existing gap between the research and clinical communities. Conventional qualitative gait analysis, typically used in clinics is mainly based on observational gait and is hence subjective and largely impacted by the observer's experience. Quantitative gait analysis, however, provides measured parameters, with good accuracy and repeatability for the diagnosis and comparative assessment throughout rehabilitation. Rapidly emerging smart wearable technology and AI, including Machine Learning, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network approaches, are increasingly commanding greater attention in gait research. Although their use in clinical settings are not yet well leveraged, these tools promise a paradigm shift in stroke gait quantification, as they provide means for acquiring, storing and analyzing multifactorial complex gait data, while capturing its non-linear dynamic variability and offering the invaluable benefits of predictive analytics. © Copyright © 2021 Mohan, Khandoker, Wasti, Ismail Ibrahim Ismail Alali, Jelinek and Khalaf.},

  abstract={(1) Background: The appearance of physician rating websites (PRWs) has raised research-ers’ interest in the online healthcare field, particularly how users consume information available on PRWs in terms of online physician reviews and providers’ information in their decision-making process. The aim of this study is to consistently review the early scientific literature related to digital healthcare platforms, summarize key findings and study features, identify literature deficiencies, and suggest digital solutions for future research. (2) Methods: A systematic literature review using key databases was conducted to search published articles between 2010 and 2020 and identified 52 papers that focused on PRWs, different signals in the form of PRWs’ features, the findings of these studies, and peer-reviewed articles. The research features and main findings are reported in tables and figures. (3) Results: The review of 52 papers identified 22 articles for online reputation, 15 for service popularity, 16 for linguistic features, 15 for doctor–patient concordance, 7 for offline repu-tation, and 11 for trustworthiness signals. Out of 52 studies, 75% used quantitative techniques, 12% employed qualitative techniques, and 13% were mixed-methods investigations. The majority of studies retrieved larger datasets using machine learning techniques (44/52). These studies were mostly conducted in China (38), the United States (9), and Europe (3). The majority of signals were positively related to the clinical outcomes. Few studies used conventional surveys of patient treatment experience (5, 9.61%), and few used panel data (9, 17%). These studies found a high degree of correlation between these signals with clinical outcomes. (4) Conclusions: PRWs contain valuable signals that provide insights into the service quality and patient treatment choice, yet it has not been extensively used for evaluating the quality of care. This study offers implications for researchers to consider digital solutions such as advanced machine learning and data mining techniques to test hypotheses regarding a variety of signals on PRWs for clinical decision-making. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Objective: The study aimed to explore existing prediction models of functioning in spinal cord injury (SCI). Study Design and Setting: The databases PubMed, EBSCOhost CINAHL Complete, and IEEE Xplore were searched for relevant literature. The search strategy included published search filters for prediction model and impact studies, index terms and keywords for SCI, and relevant outcome measures able to assess functioning as reflected in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The search was completed in October 2020. Results: We identified seven prediction model studies reporting twelve prediction models of functioning. The identified prediction models were mainly envisioned to be used for rehabilitation planning, however, also other possible applications were stated. The method predominantly used was regression analysis and the investigated predictors covered mainly the ICF components of body functions and activities and participation, next to characteristics of the health condition and health interventions. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the development of prediction models of functioning for use in clinical practice remains to be fully exploited. By providing a comprehensive overview of what has been done, this review informs future research on prediction models of functioning in SCI and contributes to an efficient use of research evidence. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been serving the field of radiology over the last 50 years. As modern medicine is evolving towards precision medicine, offering personalized patient care and treatment, the requirement for robust imaging biomarkers has gradually increased. Radiomics, a specific method generating high-throughput extraction of a tremendous amount of quantitative imaging data using data-characterization algorithms, has shown great potential in individuating imaging biomarkers. Radiomic analysis can be implemented through the following two methods: hand-crafted radiomic features extraction or deep learning algorithm. Its application in lung diseases can be used in clinical decision support systems, regarding its ability to develop descriptive and predictive models in many respiratory pathologies. The aim of this article is to review the recent literature on the topic, and briefly summarize the interest of radiomics in chest Computed Tomography (CT) and its pertinence in the field of pulmonary diseases, from a clinician’s perspective. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: Big data and real-world data (RWD) have been increasingly used to measure the effectiveness and costs in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). However, the characteristics and methodologies of CEA based on big data and RWD remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to review the characteristics and methodologies of the CEA studies based on big data and RWD and to compare the characteristics and methodologies between the CEA studies with or without decision-analytic models. Methods: The literature search was conducted in Medline (Pubmed), Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library (as of June 2020). Full CEA studies with an incremental analysis that used big data and RWD for both effectiveness and costs written in English were included. There were no restrictions regarding publication date. Results: 70 studies on CEA using RWD (37 with decision-analytic models and 33 without) were included. The majority of the studies were published between 2011 and 2020, and the number of CEA based on RWD has been increasing over the years. Few CEA studies used big data. Pharmacological interventions were the most frequently studied intervention, and they were more frequently evaluated by the studies without decision-analytic models, while those with the model focused on treatment regimen. Compared to CEA studies using decision-analytic models, both effectiveness and costs of those using the model were more likely to be obtained from literature review. All the studies using decision-analytic models included sensitivity analyses, while four studies no using the model neither used sensitivity analysis nor controlled for confounders. Conclusion: The review shows that RWD has been increasingly applied in conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis. However, few CEA studies are based on big data. In future CEA studies using big data and RWD, it is encouraged to control confounders and to discount in long-term research when decision-analytic models are not used. © Copyright © 2021 Lu, Xiong, Lee, Wu, Yuan and Jiang.},

  abstract={Background and aim: Hypoglycaemia prediction play an important role in diabetes management being able to reduce the number of dangerous situations. Thus, it is relevant to present a systematic review on the currently available prediction algorithms and models for hypoglycaemia (or hypoglycemia in US English) prediction. Methods: This study aims to systematically review the literature on data-based algorithms and models using diabetics real data for hypoglycaemia prediction. Five electronic databases were screened for studies published from January 2014 to June 2020: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and PubMed. Results: Sixty-three eligible studies were retrieved that met the inclusion criteria. The review identifies the current trend in this topic: most of the studies perform short-term predictions (82.5%). Also, the review pinpoints the inputs and shows that information fusion is relevant for hypoglycaemia prediction. Regarding data-based models (80.9%) and hybrid models (19.1%) different predictive techniques are used: Artificial neural network (22.2%), ensemble learning (27.0%), supervised learning (20.6%), statistic/probabilistic (7.9%), autoregressive (7.9%), evolutionary (6.4%), deep learning (4.8%) and adaptative filter (3.2%). Artificial Neural networks and hybrid models show better results. Conclusions: The data-based models for blood glucose and hypoglycaemia prediction should be able to provide a good balance between the applicability and performance, integrating complementary data from different sources or from different models.

Methods: A comprehensive search in PubMed, CENTRAL and EMBASE was conducted. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias were performed by two authors. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020205143. Results: After abstract and full-text screening, 36 studies comprising 18,096 infants were included. Most CDSAs evaluated heart rate (HR)-based parameters. Two publications derived from one randomised-controlled trial assessing HR characteristics reported significant reduction in 30-day septicaemia-related mortality. Thirty-four non-randomised studies found promising yet inconclusive results. Conclusion: Heart rate-based parameters are reliable components of CDSAs for sepsis prediction, particularly in combination with additional vital signs and demographics. However, inconclusive evidence and limited standardisation restricts clinical implementation of CDSAs outside of a controlled research environment. Further experimentation and comparison of parameter combinations and testing of new CDSAs are warranted. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract={Objectives: Patient representation learning refers to learning a dense mathematical representation of a patient that encodes meaningful information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is generally performed using advanced deep learning methods. This study presents a systematic review of this field and provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses from a methodological perspective. Methods: We identified studies developing patient representations from EHRs with deep learning methods from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library. After screening 363 articles, 49 papers were included for a comprehensive data collection. Results: Publications developing patient representations almost doubled each year from 2015 until 2019. We noticed a typical workflow starting with feeding raw data, applying deep learning models, and ending with clinical outcome predictions as evaluations of the learned representations. Specifically, learning representations from structured EHR data was dominant (37 out of 49 studies). Recurrent Neural Networks were widely applied as the deep learning architecture (Long short-term memory: 13 studies, Gated recurrent unit: 11 studies). Learning was mainly performed in a supervised manner (30 studies) optimized with cross-entropy loss. Disease prediction was the most common application and evaluation (31 studies). Benchmark datasets were mostly unavailable (28 studies) due to privacy concerns of EHR data, and code availability was assured in 20 studies. Discussion & Conclusion: The existing predictive models mainly focus on the prediction of single diseases, rather than considering the complex mechanisms of patients from a holistic review. We show the importance and feasibility of learning comprehensive representations of patient EHR data through a systematic review. Advances in patient representation learning techniques will be essential for powering patient-level EHR analyses. Future work will still be devoted to leveraging the richness and potential of available EHR data. Reproducibility and transparency of reported results will hopefully improve. Knowledge distillation and advanced learning techniques will be exploited to assist the capability of learning patient representation further. © 2020},

  abstract={Background and aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that attacks the brain by deposited amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangles. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of deep learning (DL) in predicting AD with an amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Materials and methods: The ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, ALZFORUM, CINAHL, Science Direct, PROSPERO, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were systematically searched. We used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool to investigate the quality and potential bias of all studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to determine diagnostic precision. All experiments were viewed with the summary ROC (SROC) plotted as a circle. Results: Overall, 17 studies (a total of 15,177 image data) were included in the final meta-analysis following reviewing titles, abstracts, and full papers. The pooled AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the amyloid tracers were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.95), and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86–0.93), respectively. The pooled AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the FDG tracers were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77–0.96), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87–0.96), and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.91), respectively. The pooled AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the Florbetapir tracers were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.86–0.98), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87–0.98), and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.87–0.99), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that DL provided a more accurate method by amyloid PET images leading to straightforward advances in the early diagnosis of diseases, such as AD. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={PURPOSE: There is a need for an improved understanding of clinical and biologic risk factors in pediatric cancer to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) represents the application of computational inference from advanced statistical methods that can be applied to increasing amount of data available for study in pediatric oncology. The goal of this systematic review was to systematically characterize the state of ML in pediatric oncology and highlight advances and opportunities in the field. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the Embase, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases for applications of ML in pediatric oncology. Query results from all three databases were aggregated and duplicate studies were removed. RESULTS: A total of 42 unique articles that examined the applications of ML in pediatric oncology met inclusion criteria for review. We identified 20 studies of CNS tumors, 13 of solid tumors, and nine of leukemia. ML tasks included classification, prediction of treatment response, and dose optimization with a variety of methods being used including neural network, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machines. Strengths of the identified studies included matching or outperforming physician comparators via automated analysis and predicting therapeutic response. Common limitations included significant heterogeneity in reporting standards, clinical applicability, small sample sizes, and missing external validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: We identified areas where ML can enhance clinical care in ways that may not otherwise be achievable. Although ML promises enormous potential in improving diagnostics, decision making, and monitoring for children with cancer, the field remains in early stages and future work will be aided by standards and guidelines to ensure rigorous methodologic design and maximizing clinical utility.  © 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

  abstract={This paper presents developmental trends in technology-based assessment in an educational context and highlights how technology-based assessment has reshaped the purpose of educational assessment and the way we think about it. Developments in technology-based assessment stretch back three decades. Around the turn of the millennium, studies centred on computer-based and paper-and-pencil test comparability to ascertain the effect of delivery medium on students' test achievement. A systematic review of media studies was conducted to detect these effects; the results were varied. Recent work has focused on logfile analysis, educational data mining and learning analytics. Developments in IT have made it possible to design different assessments, thus boosting the number of ways students can demonstrate their skills and abilities. Parallel to these advances, the focus of technology-based assessment has shifted from an individual and summative approach to one which is cooperative, diagnostic and more learning-centred to implement efficient testing for personalised learning.

  abstract={Organisations have been collecting big data - high volume structured and unstructured data - at a rapid rate from a range of different sources. Big data can add value to organisations if processed, analysed and presented correctly. Organisations can benefit significantly from big data analytics if they have the capability to uncover hidden information from fully automated decision-making process. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of big data analytics to replace managerial decision-making. A systematic literature review approach is used to review relevant studies that are validated through qualitative data analysis. The potential to replace managerial decision-making with fully automated data driven decisions varies per problem domain. There is evidence that managerial, operational and tactical decision-making can be replaced by big data analytics for stable conditions using structured data. From the study, European countries are the ones benefiting highly from tactical and operational decisions without managerial control. Decision-makers should, therefore, re-evaluate strategic decisions resulting from automated processing from unstable conditions for high quality decisions and prevention of errors. Finding from an African context were based on case studies from Egypt, Morocco and South Africa. The case study from Egypt used an experimental case on retail sector with proven decisions effectiveness. © 2021 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.},

  abstract={Background: Concussion is a growing public health concern and generating concussion prevention programs depends on identifying high-risk sports and characteristics. Identifying the roles of sport, sex, and participation level (e.g., high school versus collegiate athletics) in concussion risk would facilitate more informed decision-making regarding sports participation and generate better targeted prevention strategies. Objectives: The current study’s objectives were to: (1) determine the magnitude and hierarchy of sports-related concussion (SRC) risk across an array of events and (2) evaluate the modifying roles of sex, participation level, and session type on SRC rates. Methods: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, searching concussion studies published between 2001 and December 2019. Inclusion criteria for studies required: (1) concussion occurred during sport, (2) that the SRC was clinically diagnosed, and (3) athlete exposures and concussions could be extracted or estimated. A study was excluded if it: (1) was not an original research article, (2) was not written in English language, (3) was an animal study, (4) did not have enough data to calculate SRC rates, (5) included professional or youth sample, and/or (6) contained data collected prior to 2001. The meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were fit using a random effects model. Results: Search results returned 2695 unique research articles, with 83 studies included in analyses. Sport, sex, participation level, and session type all significantly influenced SRC rates. Overall, rugby had the highest concussion rate and was classified as the highest risk sport (28.25 concussions per 10,000 athlete exposures). Overall, females had a higher concussion rate than males. Only lacrosse demonstrated a higher concussion rate for males compared to females. Collegiate athletes had higher concussion rates than high school athletes. Games were associated with 2.01 more concussions per 10,000 AEs than practices. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated rugby has the highest concussion risk, followed by American Football, ice hockey, and wrestling. Concussion risk was influenced by sport, sex, participation, and session. Identifying the factors and environments that influence concussion risk can facilitate risk reduction and prevention strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Objective:The aim of this study was to systematically assess the application and potential benefits of natural language processing (NLP) in surgical outcomes research.Summary Background Data:Widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) has generated a massive patient data source. Traditional methods of data capture, such as billing codes and/or manual review of free-text narratives in EHRs, are highly labor-intensive, costly, subjective, and potentially prone to bias.Methods:A literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase identified all articles published starting in 2000 that used NLP models to assess perioperative surgical outcomes. Evaluation metrics of NLP systems were assessed by means of pooled analysis and meta-analysis. Qualitative synthesis was carried out to assess the results and risk of bias on outcomes.Results:The present study included 29 articles, with over half (n = 15) published after 2018. The most common outcome identified using NLP was postoperative complications (n = 14). Compared to traditional non-NLP models, NLP models identified postoperative complications with higher sensitivity [0.92 (0.87-0.95) vs 0.58 (0.33-0.79), P < 0.001]. The specificities were comparable at 0.99 (0.96-1.00) and 0.98 (0.95-0.99), respectively. Using summary of likelihood ratio matrices, traditional non-NLP models have clinical utility for confirming documentation of outcomes/diagnoses, whereas NLP models may be reliably utilized for both confirming and ruling out documentation of outcomes/diagnoses.Conclusions:NLP usage to extract a range of surgical outcomes, particularly postoperative complications, is accelerating across disciplines and areas of clinical outcomes research. NLP and traditional non-NLP approaches demonstrate similar performance measures, but NLP is superior in ruling out documentation of surgical outcomes. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract={The machine learning approach has gained a significant attention in the healthcare sector because of the prospect of developing new techniques for medical devices and handling the critical database of chronic diseases. The learning approach has potential to analyze complex medical data, disease diagnosis, and patient monitoring system, and to monitor e-health record. Non-invasive cuffless blood pressure (CLBP) measurement secured a significant position in the patient monitoring system. From a few recent decades, the importance of cuffless technology has been perceived towards continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and supplementary efforts have been made towards its continuous monitoring. However, the optimal method that measures BP unambiguously and continuously has not yet emerged along with issues like calibration time, accuracy and long-term estimation of BP with miniaturizing hardware. The present study provides an insight into several learning algorithms along with their feature selection models. Various challenges and future improvements towards the current state of machine learning in healthcare industries are discussed in the present review. The bottom line of this study is to provide a comprehensive perspective of the machine learning approach of CLBP for the generation of highly precise predictive models for continuous BP measurement.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

  abstract={In the last few decades, the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the nervous system, has increased, particularly in Northern European countries, the United States, and United Kingdom. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as tools to address problems in MS research has attracted increasing interest in these methods. Bayesian networks offer a clear advantage since they can integrate data and causal knowledge allowing for visualizing interactions between dependent variables and potential confounding factors. A review of AI/ML research methods applied to MS found 216 papers using terms “Multiple Sclerosis”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, “Bayes”, and “Bayesian”, of which 90 were relevant and recently published. More than half of these involve the detection and segmentation of MS lesions for quantitative analysis; however clinical and lifestyle risk factor assessment and prediction have largely been ignored. Of those that address risk factors, most provide only association studies for some factors and often fail to include the potential impact of confounding factors and bias (especially where these have causal explanations) that could affect data interpretation, such as reporting quality and medical care access in various countries. To address these gaps in the literature, we propose a causal Bayesian network approach to assessing risk factors for MS, which can address deficiencies in current epidemiological methods of producing risk measurements and makes better use of observational data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. Results: We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation. Conclusions: This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology. © Jiamin Yin, Kee Yuan Ngiam, Hock Hai Teo.

  abstract={Background and objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that is associated with increased mortality. Artificial intelligence tools can inform clinical decision making by flagging patients at risk of developing infection and subsequent sepsis. This systematic review aims to identify the optimal set of predictors used to train machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an infection and subsequent sepsis. Methods: This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO database (CRD42020158685). We conducted a systematic literature review across 3 large databases: Medline, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Embase. Quantitative primary research studies that focused on sepsis prediction associated with bacterial infection in adults in all care settings were eligible for inclusion. Results: Seventeen articles met our inclusion criteria. We identified 194 predictors that were used to train machine learning algorithms, with 13 predictors used on average across all included studies. The most prevalent predictors included age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake, heart rate, blood pressure, lactate level, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease (eGFR<60 mL/min), white blood cell count, liver dysfunction, surgical approach (open or minimally invasive), and pre-operative haematocrit < 30 %. All included studies used artificial intelligence techniques, with average sensitivity 75.7 ± 17.88, and average specificity 63.08 ± 22.01. Conclusion: The type of predictors influenced the predictive power and predictive timeframe of the developed machine learning algorithm. Predicting the likelihood of sepsis through artificial intelligence can help concentrate finite resources to those patients who are most at risk. Future studies should focus on developing more sensitive and specific algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Recent studies of predictive data mining for academics typically produce datasets and methods that allow them to explore data from the education system and using this method is expected to better understand students and the classification in which they study. Many published datasets and methods on predictive data mining for academics are complex and different so that a comprehensive picture of the status of predictive data mining research is lost. Identifying and reviewing trends, topics, data sets, methods and answering research questions regarding predictive data mining for academia between 2017 and 2020 is the aim of this systematic review. Based on data search, 14 related studies were selected to be further identified. The analysis of the selected studies shows that eight topics are the focus and trend topics, namely classification, recommender systems, educational data mining, knowledge discovery databases, student prediction, academic performance, predictive analysis, and predictive analysis. The use of datasets in the selected studies shows that 100% of studies use private datasets and 0% of studies use public datasets. Of the twenty-one methods, there are five methods which are the methods with the most research users in the field of data mining education prediction. Identifies no strong consensus on which algorithm performs best when the study is viewed individually. Therefore, predictive studies on data mining for academics are trying as optimally as possible in choosing an algorithm model to produce more optimal predictions. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={Introduction: Precision or personalized Medicine (PM) is used for the prevention and treatment of diseases by considering a huge amount of information about individuals variables. Due to high volume of information, AI-based computational models are required. A large set of studies conducted to examine the PM approach to improve childhood clinical outcomes. Thus, the main goal of this study was to review the application of health information technology and especially artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the treatment of childhood disease using PM. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched up to December 18, 2019. Articles that focused on informatics applications for childhood disease PM included in this study. Included papers were classified for qualitative analysis and interpreting results. The results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019. Results: From 341 citations, 62 papers met our inclusion criteria. The number of published papers that used AI methods to apply for PM in childhood diseases increased from 2010 to 2019. Our results showed that most applied methods were related to machine learning discipline. In terms of clinical scope, the largest number of clinical articles are devoted to oncology. Besides, the analysis showed that genomics was the most PM approach used regarding childhood disease. Conclusion: This systematic review examined papers that used AI methods for applying PM approaches in childhood diseases from medical informatics perspectives. Thus, it provided new insight to researchers who are interested in knowing research needs in this field. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Research has shown that serious games, digital game-based learning, and educational video games can be powerful learning instruments. However, experimental and meta-research have revealed that several moderators and variables influence the resulting learning outcomes. Advances in the areas of learning and game analytics potentially allow for controlling and improving the underlying learning processes of games by adapting their mechanics to the individual needs of the learner, to properties of the learning material, and/or to environmental factors. However, the field is young and no clear-cut guidelines are yet available. To shed more light on this topic and to identify common ground for further research, we conducted a systematic and pre-registered analysis of the literature. Particular attention was paid to different modes of adaptivity, different adaptive mechanisms in various learning domains and populations, differing theoretical frameworks, research methods, and measured concepts, as well as divergent underlying measures and analytics. Only 10 relevant papers were identified through the systematic literature search, which confirms that the field is still in its very early phases. The studies on which these papers were based, however, show promise in terms of the efficacy of adaptive educational games. Moreover, we identified an increased interest in the field of adaptive educational games and in the use of analytics. Nevertheless, we also identified a clear lack of common theoretical foundations as well as the application of rather heterogenous methods for investigating the effects of adaptivity. Most problematic was the lack of sufficient information (e.g., descriptions of used games, adaptive mechanisms), which often made it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Future studies should therefore focus on strong theory building and adhere to reporting standards across disciplines. Researchers from different disciplines must act in concert to advance the current state of the field in order to maximize its potential. © Copyright © 2021 Ninaus and Nebel.},

  abstract={The assessment of surgical technical skills to be acquired by novice surgeons has been traditionally done by an expert surgeon and is therefore of a subjective nature. Nevertheless, the recent advances on IoT (Internet of Things), the possibility of incorporating sensors into objects and environments in order to collect large amounts of data, and the progress on machine learning are facilitating a more objective and automated assessment of surgical technical skills. This paper presents a systematic literature review of papers published after 2013 discussing the objective and automated assessment of surgical technical skills. 101 out of an initial list of 537 papers were analyzed to identify: 1) the sensors used; 2) the data collected by these sensors and the relationship between these data, surgical technical skills and surgeons’ levels of expertise; 3) the statistical methods and algorithms used to process these data; and 4) the feedback provided based on the outputs of these statistical methods and algorithms. Particularly, 1) mechanical and electromagnetic sensors are widely used for tool tracking, while inertial measurement units are widely used for body tracking; 2) path length, number of sub-movements, smoothness, fixation, saccade and total time are the main indicators obtained from raw data and serve to assess surgical technical skills such as economy, efficiency, hand tremor, or mind control, and distinguish between two or three levels of expertise (novice/intermediate/advanced surgeons); 3) SVM (Support Vector Machines) and Neural Networks are the preferred statistical methods and algorithms for processing the data collected, while new opportunities are opened up to combine various algorithms and use deep learning; and 4) feedback is provided by matching performance indicators and a lexicon of words and visualizations, although there is considerable room for research in the context of feedback and visualizations, taking, for example, ideas from learning analytics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Objective: Having shown promise in other medical fields, we sought to determine whether machine learning (ML) models perform better than usual care in diagnostic and prognostic prediction for emergency department (ED) patients. Methods: In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Central, and CINAHL from inception to October 17, 2019. We included studies comparing diagnostic and prognostic prediction of ED patients by ML models to usual care methods (triage-based scores, clinical prediction tools, clinician judgment) using predictor variables readily available to ED clinicians. We extracted commonly reported performance metrics of model discrimination and classification. We used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020158129). Results: The search yielded 1,656 unique records, of which 23 studies involving 16,274,647 patients were included. In all seven diagnostic studies, ML models outperformed usual care in all performance metrics. In six studies assessing in-hospital mortality, the best-performing ML models had better discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] =0.74–0.94) than any clinical decision tool (AUROC =0.68–0.81). In four studies assessing hospitalization, ML models had better discrimination (AUROC =0.80–0.83) than triage-based scores (AUROC =0.68–0.82). Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Most studies had high risk of bias due to lack of external validation, low event rates, and insufficient reporting of calibration. Conclusions: Our review suggests that ML may have better prediction performance than usual care for ED patients with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes. However, prediction model reporting guidelines should be followed to provide clinically applicable data. Interventional trials are needed to assess the impact of ML models on patient-centered outcomes. © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine},

  abstract={Osteoporosis and its clinical consequence, bone fracture, is a multifactorial disease that has been the object of extensive research. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to make impressive breakthroughs in complex data environments where human capacity to identify high-dimensional relationships is limited. The field of osteoporosis is one such domain, notwithstanding technical and clinical concerns regarding the application of ML methods. This qualitative review is intended to outline some of these concerns and to inform stakeholders interested in applying AI for improved management of osteoporosis. A systemic search in PubMed and Web of Science resulted in 89 studies for inclusion in the review. These covered one or more of four main areas in osteoporosis management: bone properties assessment (n = 13), osteoporosis classification (n = 34), fracture detection (n = 32), and risk prediction (n = 14). Reporting and methodological quality was determined by means of a 12-point checklist. In general, the studies were of moderate quality with a wide range (mode score 6, range 2 to 11). Major limitations were identified in a significant number of studies. Incomplete reporting, especially over model selection, inadequate splitting of data, and the low proportion of studies with external validation were among the most frequent problems. However, the use of images for opportunistic osteoporosis diagnosis or fracture detection emerged as a promising approach and one of the main contributions that ML could bring to the osteoporosis field. Efforts to develop ML-based models for identifying novel fracture risk factors and improving fracture prediction are additional promising lines of research. Some studies also offered insights into the potential for model-based decision-making. Finally, to avoid some of the common pitfalls, the use of standardized checklists in developing and sharing the results of ML models should be encouraged. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR). © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).},

  abstract={No tools are currently available to predict whether a patient suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) will respond to a certain treatment. Machine learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown potential in predicting response for individual patients, which may enable personalized treatment decisions and increase treatment efficacy. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of MRI-guided response prediction in MDD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies using MRI to predict single-subject response to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. Classification performance was calculated using a bivariate model and expressed as area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, we analyzed differences in classification performance between different interventions and MRI modalities. Meta-analysis of 22 samples including 957 patients showed an overall area under the bivariate summary receiver operating curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81–0.87), sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 71–82), and specificity of 79% (95% CI 73–84). Although classification performance was higher for electroconvulsive therapy outcome prediction (n = 285, 80% sensitivity, 83% specificity) than medication outcome prediction (n = 283, 75% sensitivity, 72% specificity), there was no significant difference in classification performance between treatments or MRI modalities. Prediction of treatment response using machine learning analysis of MRI data is promising but should not yet be implemented into clinical practice. Future studies with more generalizable samples and external validation are needed to establish the potential of MRI to realize individualized patient care in MDD. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={In the last two decades, interactive visualization and analysis have become a central tool in data-driven decision making. Concurrently to the contributions in data visualization, research in data management has produced technology that directly benefits interactive analysis. Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent field, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between specificity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We find that five notions in data management venues fit interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, muiti-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we find a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract={Objectives: To undertake the first systematic review examining the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of acquired pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Methods: Searches of Medline, Embase and Web of Science were undertaken on 1 July 2020. Original publications studying AI applied to cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of acquired PAH in adults were identified through two-staged double-blinded review. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine frameworks. Narrative synthesis was undertaken following Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines. This review received no funding and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ID:CRD42020196295). Results: Searches returned 476 citations. Three retrospective observational studies, published between 2016 and 2020, were selected for data-extraction. Two methods applied to cardiac-MRI demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with the best model achieving AUC=0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93), 89% sensitivity and 81% specificity. Stronger results were achieved using cardiac- MRI for classification of idiopathic PAH, achieving AUC=0.97 (95% CI: 0.89-1.0), 96% sensitivity and 87% specificity. One study reporting CT-based AI demonstrated lower accuracy, with 64.6% sensitivity and 97.0% specificity. Conclusions: Automated methods for identifying PAH on cardiac-MRI are emerging with high diagnostic accuracy. AI applied to cross-sectional imaging may provide non-invasive support to reduce diagnostic delay in PAH. This would be helped by stronger solutions in other modalities.  © 2021 The Authors.},

  abstract={Forensic odontology (FO) mainly deals with the identification of the individual through the remains, which mainly includes teeth and jawbones. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has proven to be a breakthrough in providing reliable information in decision making in forensic sciences. This systematic review aimed to report on the application and performance of AI technology in FO. The data was gathered through searching for the articles in the renowned search engines, which have been published between January 2000 - June 2020. QUADAS-2 was adopted for the risk of bias analysis of the included studies. AI technology has been widely applied in FO for identifying bite-marks, predicting mandibular morphology, gender determination, and age estimation. Most of these AI models are based on either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results of the studies are promising. Studies have reported that these models display accuracy and precision equivalent to that of the trained examiners. These models can be promising tools when identifying victims of mass disasters and as an additive aid in medico-legal situations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Modern Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide continuous monitoring of critically ill patients susceptible to many complications affecting morbidity and mortality. ICU settings require a high staff-to-patient ratio and generates a sheer volume of data. For clinicians, the real-time interpretation of data and decision-making is a challenging task. Machine Learning (ML) techniques in ICUs are making headway in the early detection of high-risk events due to increased processing power and freely available datasets such as the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC). We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effectiveness of applying ML in the ICU settings using the MIMIC dataset. A total of 322 articles were reviewed and a quantitative descriptive analysis was performed on 61 qualified articles that applied ML techniques in ICU settings using MIMIC data. We assembled the qualified articles to provide insights into the areas of application, clinical variables used, and treatment outcomes that can pave the way for further adoption of this promising technology and possible use in routine clinical decision-making. The lessons learned from our review can provide guidance to researchers on application of ML techniques to increase their rate of adoption in healthcare. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective here is to gain knowledge about machine learning and specifically neural networks and their present applications in healthcare, also to understand the technological and social challenges. Various machine learning techniques are being used in healthcare as predictive models as they achieve high accuracy results at great speeds, and they have applications in nearly all departments of a hospital. Neural networks and predictive scores are the most used techniques as they can be used to find results which are almost impossible for humans to predict like mortality rate etc. Most of the data used for training these models must be preprocessed as it may range from electronic health records to medical images like MRI, CT Scans etc. Image analysis using convolutional neural networks new discoveries are being made, while broadening the understanding of the previously known theory.

To avoid the crisis of AMR, we have to fundamentally change our approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a new paradigm to combat AMR. Thus, various AI approaches to this problem have sprung up, some of which may be considered successful cases of domain-specific AI applications in AMR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic review illustrating the use of these AI-based applications for AMR. Therefore, this review briefly introduces how to employ AI technology against AMR by using the predictive AMR model, the rational use of antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antibiotic combinations, as well as future research directions. © 2021},

  abstract={Purpose: Advanced medical image analytics is increasingly used to predict clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumors. This review provides an overview on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD42019128408). PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Original studies reporting on the value of radiomics in predicting response to treatment in patients with a gastrointestinal tumor were included. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted. Results were stratified by tumor type. Quality assessment of included studies was performed, according to the radiomics quality score. Results: The comprehensive literature search identified 1360 unique studies, of which 60 articles were included for analysis. In 37 studies, radiomics models and individual radiomic features showed good predictive performance for response to treatment (area under the curve or accuracy > 0.75). Various strategies to construct predictive models were used. Internal validation of predictive models was often performed, while the majority of studies lacked external validation. None of the studies reported predictive models implemented in clinical practice. Conclusion: Radiomics is increasingly used to predict response to treatment in patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer. This review demonstrates its great potential to help predict response to treatment and improve patient selection and early adjustment of treatment strategy in a non-invasive manner. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Timely identification of patients at a high risk of clinical deterioration is key to prioritizing care, allocating resources effectively, and preventing adverse outcomes. Vital signs–based, aggregate-weighted early warning systems are commonly used to predict the risk of outcomes related to cardiorespiratory instability and sepsis, which are strong predictors of poor outcomes and mortality. Machine learning models, which can incorporate trends and capture relationships among parameters that aggregate-weighted models cannot, have recently been showing promising results. Objective: This study aimed to identify, summarize, and evaluate the available research, current state of utility, and challenges with machine learning–based early warning systems using vital signs to predict the risk of physiological deterioration in acutely ill patients, across acute and ambulatory care settings. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed, original studies with keywords related to “vital signs,” “clinical deterioration,” and “machine learning.” Included studies used patient vital signs along with demographics and described a machine learning model for predicting an outcome in acute and ambulatory care settings. Data were extracted following PRISMA, TRIPOD, and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Results: We identified 24 peer-reviewed studies from 417 articles for inclusion; 23 studies were retrospective, while 1 was prospective in nature. Care settings included general wards, intensive care units, emergency departments, step-down units, medical assessment units, postanesthetic wards, and home care. Machine learning models including logistic regression, tree-based methods, kernel-based methods, and neural networks were most commonly used to predict the risk of deterioration. The area under the curve for models ranged from 0.57 to 0.97. Conclusions: In studies that compared performance, reported results suggest that machine learning–based early warning systems can achieve greater accuracy than aggregate-weighted early warning systems but several areas for further research were identified. While these models have the potential to provide clinical decision support, there is a need for standardized outcome measures to allow for rigorous evaluation of performance across models. Further research needs to address the interpretability of model outputs by clinicians, clinical efficacy of these systems through prospective study design, and their potential impact in different clinical settings. © Sankavi Muralitharan, Walter Nelson, Shuang Di, Michael McGillion, PJ Devereaux, Neil Grant Barr, Jeremy Petch.},

  abstract={The authors have carried out a systematic review of the literature devoted to the current state of and prospects for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of maternal and fetal health. They have revealed the concept of AI and the ways of its development in medicine. It has been noted that AI does not replace a physician, but it is a tool for improving medical activity. The article shows the possibilities of AI use in obstetrics and gynecology and highlights its areas: medical image recognition; prediction and assistance to physicians in determining the diagnosis; creation of recommendation systems for selecting a treatment; robotization of medical manipulations and augmented reality; optimization of the routine functions of healthcare workers; services for interaction and training of physicians and patients. In addition, AI can be used for scientific purposes to understand complex multifactorial mechanisms for the development of diseases; to create disease information models, new classifications of diseases, and models of therapeutic effects. AI is also able to automatically retrieve new medical information from clinical case reports and scientific publications. The paper gives specific examples of developments in these areas. It considers the expected difficulties in introducing AI systems and describes immediate steps for their implementation. The development of AI systems requires physicians’ direct participation, including the selection and preparation of data, the formulation of medical tasks, and their translation into the language of machine learning specialists. It is concluded that AI-based applications in obstetrics and gynecology have already become a reality, and in the near future they will reduce the burden on medical professionals, improve the effectiveness of diagnosis, prediction, and treatment, and prevent medical errors. It is promising to use AI in telemedicine systems to provide assistance to physicians and patients outside the locations of large medical complexes. Conclusion. The results of the review can be used to identify promising researches, to develop a national program for AI introduction in obstetric and gynecological practice and in educational programs, and to improve the qualification of healthcare workers. © A group of authors, 2021.},

  abstract={Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) includes software systems combined with applied methods and algorithms which main feature is the ability to solve intellectual problems. One of the most popular trend of AI application is the prognosis of various situations,evaluation of any digital information with an attempt to give a conclusion and analysis of different data with a search for hidden patterns.Study design Systematic review. Purpose To assess current possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) for predicting unfavorableconditions in spine surgery that require medical care, and future development prospects in this area. Materials and methods UntilJune 2020 we performed a search using the Protocol (PRISMA) "Preferred Reporting Parameters for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyzes"and keywords for articles in Medline, Scopus and eLIBRARY intended to summarize the available data on algorithms forpredicting any pathological conditions in spine surgery that require medical intervention using artificial intelligence technologies.Results 20 publications were selected for systematic review, which presented data on the application of artificial intelligence, machinelearning and neural networks to predict any condition in spine surgery. According to the review, the data obtained indicate that AI canbe successfully used to optimize prognosis in various diseases of the spine. Therefore, the application of AI in the clinical practice of thespine surgeons can improve treatment results. Conclusion The promotion of artificial intelligence application in medicine is inevitable.Currently AI shows good results in the area of making clinical decisions by the surgeons and the ability to predict treatment resultsdepending on certain factors. It is imperative that spinal surgeons should realize the potential of these new technologies. Nevertheless,some factors that determine the clinical application of artificial intelligence, i.e. the ability to consider the context of a patient's history,are difficult to calculate mathematically and, so far, are difficult for an algorithmic approach. Eventually, the doctors will continueto play a vital role in patients’ treatment, and artificial intelligence will not depreciate their clinical skills, but make them even moreimportant © Pereverzev V.S., Kazmin A.I., Sazhnev M.L., Panteleev A.A., Kolesov S.V., 2021},

  abstract={Background: Breast cancer represents uncontrolled breast cell growth. Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer improves the chances of survival and increases treatment options. There are various methods for screening breast cancer, such as mammogram, ultrasound, computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI is gaining prominence as an alternative screening tool for early detection and breast cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, MRI can hardly be examined without the use of a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework, due to the vast amount of data. Objective: This paper aims to cover the approaches used in the CAD system for the detection of breast cancer. Methods: In this paper, the methods used in CAD systems are categories into two classes: the conventional approach and artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Results: The conventional approach covers the basic steps of image processing, such as preprocess-ing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The AI approach covers the various convolutional and deep learning networks used for diagnosis. Conclusion: This review discusses some of the core concepts used in breast cancer and presents a comprehensive review of efforts in the past to address this problem. © 2021, Bentham Science Publishers.

  abstract={Learning analytics (LA) collects, analyses, and reports big data about learners to optimise learning. LA ethics is an interdisciplinary field of study that addresses moral, legal, and social issues; therefore, institutions are responsible for implementing frameworks that integrate these topics. Many of the ethical issues raised apply equally to educational data sets of any size. However, in this study, we focus on big data that increases the scale and granularity of data gathered. The purpose of this study is twofold: (a) to critically review the published (2011–2018) scientific literature on LA ethics issues and (b) to identify current trends and answer research questions in the field. This study’s research questions are as follows: what is essential in LA ethics for key educational stakeholders, and what should a proposed checklist for LA ethics include for specific educational stakeholders? After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, journals, and conferences, a literature review identified 53 articles from a sample of 562. The selected articles, based on critical and qualitative content analysis, were exhaustively analysed. The findings demonstrate the shortage of empirical evidence-based guidelines on LA ethics and highlight the need to establish codes of practices to monitor and evaluate LA ethics policies. Finally, this work proposes a useful checklist as an instructional design model for scholars, policymakers, and instructional designers, so that trusted partners may use LA responsibly to improve teaching and learning. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

  abstract={Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are becoming increasingly popular in activity classification and workload measurement in sport. This systematic literature review focuses on upper body activity classification in court or field-based sports. The aim of this paper is to provide sport scientists and coaches with an overview of the past research in this area, as well as the processes and challenges involved in activity classification. The SPORTDiscus, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched, resulting in 20 articles. Both manually defined algorithms and machine learning approaches have been used to classify IMU data with varying degrees of success. Manually defined algorithms may offer simplicity and reduced computational demand, whereas machine learning may be beneficial for complex classification problems. Inter-study results show that no one machine learning model is best for activity classification; differences in sensor placement, IMU specification and pre-processing decisions can all affect model performance. Accurate classification of sporting activities could benefit players, coaches and team medical personnel by providing an objective estimate of workload. This could help to prevent injuries, enhance performance and provide valuable data to coaching staff. © IMechE 2020.},

  abstract={Biomarker-based predictive tests for subjectively asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are utilized in research today. Novel applications of artificial intelligence (AI) promise to predict the onset of AD several years in advance without determining biomarker thresholds. Until now, little attention has been paid to the new ethical challenges that AI brings to the early diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals, beyond contributing to research purposes, when we still lack adequate treatment. The aim of this paper is to explore the ethical arguments put forward for AI aided AD prediction in subjectively asymptomatic individuals and their ethical implications. The ethical assessment is based on a systematic literature search. Thematic analysis was conducted inductively of 18 included publications. The ethical framework includes the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Reasons for offering predictive tests to asymptomatic individuals are the right to know, a positive balance of the risk-benefit assessment, and the opportunity for future planning. Reasons against are the lack of disease modifying treatment, the accuracy and explicability of AI aided prediction, the right not to know, and threats to social rights. We conclude that there are serious ethical concerns in offering early diagnosis to asymptomatic individuals and the issues raised by the application of AI add to the already known issues. Nevertheless, pre-symptomatic testing should only be offered on request to avoid inflicted harm. We recommend developing training for physicians in communicating AI aided prediction. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Human-activity recognition has gained significant attention recently within the computer vision and machine learning community, due to its applications in diverse fields such as health, entertainment, visual surveillance and sports analytics. An important sub-category of human-activity recognition is group activity recognition (GAR) where a group of individuals is involved in an activity. The main challenge in such recognition tasks is to learn the relationship between a group of individuals in a scene and its evolution over time. Recently, many techniques based on deep networks and graphical models have been proposed for group activity recognition. In this paper, we critically analyze the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for group activity recognition. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the SOTA techniques conducted in the field of group activity recognition and divide the existing literature into different subcategories. We also identify the available datasets and the existing research challenges for GAR. © 2021 IEEE.},

Numerous machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied in medical information systems. These can significantly contribute to the decision-making process, such as diagnosis, prediction, and exploring the benefits of clinical care. This study aims to determine insights into the current state of data mining applications employed by ML in the field of medical informatics (MI). We believe that this exploration would lead to many unrevealed answers in predictive modelling in medical informatics. A systematic search was performed in the most influential scientific electronic databases and one specific another database between 2016 to 2020 (April). Research questions are outlined after the researcher has studied previous research done on the subject. We identified 51 related samples out of 1224 searched articles that satisfied our inclusion criteria. There is a significant increasing pattern of ML application in MI. In addition, the most popular algorithm for classification problem is Support Vector Machine (SVM), followed by random forest (RF). In contrast, "Accuracy" and "Specificity" are the most commonly used mechanisms for performance indicators calculation. This systematic literature review provides a new paradigm for the application of ML to MI. By this investigation, the unknown areas of ML on MI were explored. © 2021, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Chronic diseases are becoming more widespread. Treatment and monitoring of these diseases require going to hospitals frequently, which increases the burdens of hospitals and patients. Presently, advancements in wearable sensors and communication protocol contribute to enriching the healthcare system in a way that will reshape healthcare services shortly. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is the foremost of these advancements. RPM systems are based on the collection of patient vital signs extracted using invasive and noninvasive techniques, then sending them in real-time to physicians. These data may help physicians in taking the right decision at the right time. The main objective of this paper is to outline research directions on remote patient monitoring, explain the role of AI in building RPM systems, make an overview of the state of the art of RPM, its advantages, its challenges, and its probable future directions. For studying the literature, five databases have been chosen (i.e., science direct, IEEE-Explore, Springer, PubMed, and science.gov). We followed the (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) PRISMA, which is a standard methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 56 articles are reviewed based on the combination of a set of selected search terms including RPM, data mining, clinical decision support system, electronic health record, cloud computing, internet of things, and wireless body area network. The result of this study approved the effectiveness of RPM in improving healthcare delivery, increase diagnosis speed, and reduce costs. To this end, we also present the chronic disease monitoring system as a case study to provide enhanced solutions for RPMs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

AI can precisely analyze an enormous dataset of images (fluorescent, hyperspectral, cytology, CT images, etc.) to diagnose OC. AI can accurately predict the occurrence of OC, as compared to conventional methods, by analyzing predisposing factors like age, gender, tobacco habits, and bio-markers.

  abstract={The purpose of this analysis is to assess the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the prediction of post-operative outcomes, including complications, recurrence, and death in transsphenoidal surgery. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed all papers that used at least one ML algorithm to predict outcomes after transsphenoidal surgery. We searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to May 12th, 2021. We identified 13 studies enrolling 5048 patients. We extracted the general characteristics of each study; the sensitivity, specificity, AUC of the ML models developed as well as the features identified as important by the ML models. We identified 12 studies with 5048 patients that included ML algorithms for adenomas, three with 1807 patients specifically for acromegaly, and five with 2105 patients specifically for Cushing's disease. Nearly all were single institution studies. The studies used a heterogeneous mix of ML algorithms and features to build predictive models. All papers reported an AUC greater than.7, which indicates clinical utility. ML algorithms have the potential to predict post-operative outcomes of transsphenoidal surgery and can improve patient care. Ensemble algorithms and neural networks were often top performers when compared to other ML algorithms. Biochemical and pre-operative features were most likely to be selected as important by ML models. Inexplicability remains a challenge, but algorithms such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation or Shapley value can increase explainability of ML algorithms. Our analysis shows that ML algorithms have the potential to greatly assist surgeons in clinical decision making. © 2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MetS), known to substantially lower the quality of life is associated with the increased incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Evidence suggests that MetS accounts for the highest global mortality rate. For the early and accurate diagnosis of MetS, various statistical and ML techniques have been developed to support its clinical diagnosis. We performed a systematic review to investigate the various statistical and machine learning techniques (ML) that have been used to support the clinical diagnoses of MetS from the earliest studies to December 2020. Published literature relating to statistical and ML techniques for the diagnosis of MetS were identified by searching five major scientific databases: PubMed, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM digital library, and SpringerLink. Fifty-seven primary studies that met the inclusion criteria were obtained after screening titles, abstracts and full text. Three main types of techniques were identified: statistical (n=10), ML (n=44), and risk quantification (n=3). Standardized Z-score is the only statistical technique identified while the ML techniques include principal component analysis, confirmatory factory analysis, artificial neural networks, multiple logistics regression, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and Bayesian networks. The areal similarity degree risk quantification, framingham risk score and simScore were the three risk quantification techniques identified. Evidence suggests that evaluated ML techniques, with accuracy ranging from 75.5% to 98.9%, can more accurately diagnose MetS than both statistical and risk quantification techniques. The standardised Z-score is the most frequent statistical technique identified. However, highlighted proof based on performance measures indicate that the decision tree and artificial neural network ML techniques have the highest predictive performance for the prediction of MetS. Evidence suggests that more accurate diagnosis of MetS is required to evaluate the predictive performance of the statistical and ML techniques. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract={Objectives: To assess the methodological quality and risk of bias in radiomics studies investigating diagnosis, therapy response, and survival of patients with osteosarcoma. Methods: In this systematic review, literatures on radiomics in osteosarcoma were included and assessed for methodological quality through the radiomics quality score (RQS). The risk of bias and concern of application was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. A meta-analysis of studies focusing on predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. Results: Twelve radiomics studies exploring osteosarcoma were identified, and five were included in meta-analysis. The RQS reached an average of 20.4% (6.92 of 36) with good inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Four studies validated results with an internal dataset, none of which used external dataset; one study was prospectively designed, and another one shared part of the dataset. The risk of bias and concern of application were mainly related to index test aspect. The meta-analysis showed a diagnostic odds ratio of 43.68 (95%CI 13.5-141.31) for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with high heterogeneity and low methodological quality. Conclusions: The overall scientific quality of included studies is insufficient; however, radiomics remains a promising technology for predicting treatment response, which might guide therapeutic decision-making and related to prognosis. Improvements in study design, validation, and open science needs to be made to demonstrate the generalizability of findings and to achieve clinical applications. Widespread application of RQS, pre-trained RQS scoring procedure, and modification of RQS in response to clinical needs are necessary. Key Points: • Limited radiomics studies were established in osteosarcoma with mean RQS of 20.4%, commonly due to unvalidated results, retrospective study design, and absence of open science. • Meta-analysis of radiomics studies predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed high diagnostic odds ratio 43.68, while high heterogeneity and low methodological quality were the main concerns. • A previously trained data extraction instrument allowed reaching moderate inter-rater agreement in RQS applications, while RQS still needs improvement to become a wide adaptive tool in reviews of radiomics studies, in routine self-check before manuscript submitting and in study design. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.},

  abstract={Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a type of arrhythmia characterized by irregular heartbeats, with four types, two of which are complicated to diagnose using standard techniques such as Electrocardiogram (ECG). However, and because smart wearables are increasingly a piece of commodity equipment, there are several ways of detecting and predicting AF episodes using only an ECG exam, allowing physicians easier diagnosis. By searching several databases, this study presents a review of the articles published in the last ten years, focusing on those who reported studies using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for prediction of AF. The results show that only twelve studies were selected for this systematic review, where three of them applied deep learning techniques (25%), six of them used machine learning methods (50%) and three others focused on applying general artificial intelligence models (25%). To conclude, this study revealed that the prediction of AF is yet an under-developed field in the context of AI, and deep learning techniques are increasing the accuracy, but these are not as frequently applied as it would be expected. Also, more than half of the selected studies were published since 2016, corroborating that this topic is very recent and has a high potential for additional research.  © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3%) were excluded and 58 (17.7%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions: Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients' daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice. © Aziliz Le Glaz, Yannis Haralambous, Deok-Hee Kim-Dufor, Philippe Lenca, Romain Billot, Taylor C Ryan, Jonathan Marsh, Jordan DeVylder, Michel Walter, Sofian Berrouiguet, Christophe Lemey.

  abstract={Artificial intelligence is a broad field that comprises a wide range of techniques, where deep learning is presently the one with the most impact. Moreover, the medical field is an area where data both complex and massive and the importance of the decisions made by doctors make it one of the fields in which deep learning techniques can have the greatest impact. A systematic review following the Cochrane recommendations with a multidisciplinary team comprised of physicians, research methodologists and computer scientists has been conducted. This survey aims to identify the main therapeutic areas and the deep learning models used for diagnosis and treatment tasks. The most relevant databases included were MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Central, Astrophysics Data System, Europe PubMed Central, Web of Science and Science Direct. An inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined and applied in the first and second peer review screening. A set of quality criteria was developed to select the papers obtained after the second screening. Finally, 126 studies from the initial 3493 papers were selected and 64 were described. Results show that the number of publications on deep learning in medicine is increasing every year. Also, convolutional neural networks are the most widely used models and the most developed area is oncology where they are used mainly for image analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Introduction: In recent years, machine learning algorithms have led to innovative tools for medical imaging analysis. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the literature on the developing field of deep learning (DL), particularly the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PET/CT and PET/MR. Methods: We performed the literature search, referring to “convolutional neural networks” and “positron emission tomography” on PubMed/MEDLINE, for potentially relevant articles published up until July 24th, 2020. Results: After the screening process, 63 articles were finally included; these embraced both the technical (n = 23) and the clinical field (n = 40). Technical studies aimed at investigating the role of CNN-based methods for image quality improvement (n = 11) and on technical issues (n = 12), mainly attenuation correction. Clinical studies explored CNN applications in oncology lung cancer (n = 7), head and neck cancer (n = 4), esophageal cancer (n = 2), lymphoma (n = 3), prostate cancer (N = 4), cervical cancer (n = 1), sarcomas (n = 1), multiple cancer types (n = 4), in neurology (n = 10) and cardiology (n = 1); three additional studies belonged to “other” category. In oncology, the studies aimed at detection, diagnosis, and prognostication of cancer. In neurology, the majority of the studies aimed at diagnosing Alzheimer Disease and stratification of the risk. CNN-based algorithms demonstrated promising results with performances equal or even higher compared to conventional approaches. Discussion: Overall, CNN applications for PET/CT and PET/MR are exponentially growing, demonstrating encouraging results for both technical and clinical purposes. Novel research strategies emerged to face the challenges of DL algorithms development. Education and confidence with DL-based tools are needed for proper technology implementation. © 2021, Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.},

  abstract={Breast cancer prevails as the most widespread and second deadliest cancer in women. The typical symptoms of breast cancer are minimal and curable when the tumor is small, hence screening is crucial for timely detection. Since delayed diagnosis contributes to considerable number of deaths, a number of cross-disciplinary techniques have been introduced in medical sciences to aid healthcare experts in the swift detection of breast cancer. A vast amount of data is collected in the process of breast cancer detection and therapy through consultation reports, histopathological images, blood test reports, mammography results etc. This data can generate highly powerful prediction models, if properly used that can serve as a support system to assist doctors in the early breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses the need of machine learning for breast cancer detection, presents a systematic review of recent and notable works for precise detection of breast cancer, followed by a comparative analysis of the machine learning models covered in these studies. Then, we have performed breast cancer detection and prognosis on three benchmark datasets of Wisconsin, using seven popular machine learning techniques, and noted the findings. In our experimental setup, K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest perform with the highest accuracy of 97.14% over Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (original). Moreover, random forest displays best performance over all the three datasets. Finally, the paper summarizes the challenges faced together with conclusions drawn and prospective scope of machine learning in breast cancer detection and prognosis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

  abstract={Research into machine learning (ML) for clinical vascular analysis, such as those useful for stroke and coronary artery disease, varies greatly between imaging modalities and vascular regions. Limited accessibility to large diverse patient imaging datasets, as well as a lack of transparency in specific methods, are obstacles to further development. This paper reviews the current status of quantitative vascular ML, identifying advantages and disadvantages common to all imaging modalities. Literature from the past 8 years was systematically collected from MEDLINE® and Scopus database searches in January 2021. Papers satisfying all search criteria, including a minimum of 50 patients, were further analysed and extracted of relevant data, for a total of 47 publications. Current ML image segmentation, disease risk prediction, and pathology quantitation methods have shown sensitivities and specificities over 70%, compared to expert manual analysis or invasive quantitation. Despite this, inconsistencies in methodology and the reporting of results have prevented inter-model comparison, impeding the identification of approaches with the greatest potential. The clinical potential of this technology has been well demonstrated in Computed Tomography of coronary artery disease, but remains practically limited in other modalities and body regions, particularly due to a lack of routine invasive reference measurements and patient datasets. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Institutions (companies or organizations) due to the high level of complexity of their processes and the need to expand competitive advantages make use of Management Information Systems (MIS) to give their managers correct and immediate information for decision-making. Specifically, federal universities, that search for other objectives (quality, efficiency in their final area - education) also depend on these same MIS to achieve their management objectives. However, the lack of data systematization, lack of systems models, and a wide and complex decision-making structure make these institutions have difficulties in presenting their information correctly, unified, and standardized. From this context, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the implementation process of Business Intelligence (BI) in federal institutions of education with the premise of characterizing the information model contained in these institutions. As a methodology, a Systematic Review was established with an emphasis on three aspects: delimitation of the theme; review protocol and conducting the review. The results obtained in the analysis point towards the use of Big Data and Data Mining to support decision-making. © 20th International Conferences on WWW/Internet 2021 and Applied Computing 2021.},

Methods We systematically reviewed publications retrieved from MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase between 31 May 1999 and 30 April 2020, supplemented by hand search of reference lists and consultation with an expert Technical Advisory Panel. Studies evaluating prognostic factors or clinical prediction models in children presenting from the community with febrile illnesses were eligible. The primary outcome was any objective measure of disease severity ascertained within 30 days of enrolment. We calculated unadjusted likelihood ratios (LRs) for comparison of prognostic factors, and compared clinical prediction models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Risk of bias and applicability of studies were assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. Results Of 5949 articles identified, 18 studies evaluating 200 prognostic factors and 25 clinical prediction models in 24 530 children were included. Heterogeneity between studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Malnutrition (positive LR range 1.56-11.13), hypoxia (2.10-8.11), altered consciousness (1.24-14.02), and markers of acidosis (1.36-7.71) and poor peripheral perfusion (1.78-17.38) were the most common predictors of severe disease. Clinical prediction model performance varied widely (AUROC range 0.49-0.97). Concerns regarding applicability were identified and most studies were at high risk of bias. Conclusions Few studies address this important public health question. We identified prognostic factors from a wide range of geographic contexts that can help clinicians assess febrile children at risk of progressing to severe disease. Multicentre studies that include outpatients are required to explore generalisability and develop data-driven tools to support patient prioritisation and triage at the community level.

  abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to analyze and measure the effects of intellectual capital (IC), i.e. human capital (HC), relational capital (RC) and structural capital (SC), on healthcare industry organizational performance and understanding the role of data analytics and big data (BD) in healthcare value creation (Wang et al., 2018). Through the assessment of determined variables specific for each component of IC, the paper identifies the guidelines and suggests propositions for a more efficient response in terms of services provided to citizens and, specifically, patients, as well as predicting effective strategies to improve the care management efficiency in terms of cost reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The study has a twofold approach: in the first part, the authors operated a systematic review of the academic literature aiming to enquire the relationship between IC, big data analytics (BDA) and healthcare system, which were also the descriptors employed. In the second part, the authors built an econometric model analyzed through panel data analysis, studying the relationship between IC, namely human, relational and structural capital indicators, and the performance of healthcare system in terms of performance. The study has been conducted on a sample of 28 European countries, notwithstanding the belonging to specific international or supranational bodies, between 2011 and 2016. Findings: The paper proposes a data-driven model that presents new approach to IC assessment, extendable to other economic sectors beyond healthcare. It shows the existence of a positive impact (turning into a mathematical inverse relationship) of the human, relational and structural capital on the performance indicator, while the physical assets (i.e. the available beds in hospitals on total population) positively mediates the relationship, turning into a negative impact of non-IC related inputs on healthcare performance. The result is relevant in terms of managerial implications, enhancing the opportunity to highlight the crucial role of IC in the healthcare sector. Research limitations/implications: The relationship between IC indicators and performance could be employed in other sectors, disseminating new approaches in academic research. Through the establishment of a relationship between IC factors and performance, the authors implemented an approach in which healthcare organizations are active participants in their economic and social value creation. This challenges the views of knowledge sharing deeply held inside organizations by creating “new value” developed through a more collaborative and permeated approach in terms of knowledge spillovers. A limitation is given by a fragmented policymaking process which carries out different results in each country. Practical implications: The analysis provides interesting implications on multiple perspectives. The novelty of the study provides interesting implications for managers, practitioners and governmental bodies. A more efficient healthcare system could provide better results in terms of cost minimization and reduction of hospitalization period. Moreover, dissemination of new scientific knowledge and drivers of specialization enhances best practices sharing in the healthcare sector. On the other hand, an improvement in preventive medicine practices could help in reducing the overload of demand for curative treatments, on the perspective of sharply decreasing the avoidable deaths rate and improving societal standards. Originality/value: The authors provide a new holistic framework on the relationship between IC, BDA and organizational performance in healthcare organizations through a systematic review approach and an empirical panel analysis at a multinational level, which is quite a novelty regarding the healthcare. There is little research focussed on healthcare industries' organizational performance, and, specifically, most of the research on IC in healthcare delivered results in terms of theoretical contribution and qualitative analyzes. The authors even contributed to analyze the healthcare industry in the light of the possible existence of synergies and networks among countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract={Background: Predictive modeling promises to improve our understanding of what variables influence patient satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this article was to systematically review the relevant literature using predictive models of clinical outcomes after TKA. The aim was to identify the predictor strategies used for systematic data collection with the highest likelihood of success in predicting clinical outcomes. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol systematic review was conducted using 3 databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed) to identify all clinical studies that had used predictive models or that assessed predictive features for outcomes after TKA between 1996 and 2020. The ROBINS-I tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies and the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 studies were identified of which 48 met our inclusion criteria. Preoperative predictive factors strongly associated with postoperative clinical outcomes were knee pain, knee-specific Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) scores, and mental health scores. Demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and knee alignment had an inconsistent association with outcomes. The outcome measures that correlated best with the predictive models were improvement of PROM scores, pain scores, and patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Several algorithms, based on PROM improvement, patient satisfaction, or pain after TKA, have been developed to improve decision-making regarding both indications for surgery and surgical strategy. Functional features such as preoperative pain and PROM scores were highly predictive for clinical outcomes after TKA. Some variables such as demographics data or knee alignment were less strongly correlated with TKA outcomes. Level of evidence: Systematic review – Level III. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={This study explores the roles and research foci of AILEd (Artificial Intelligence in Language Education). The AILEd studies published from 1990 to 2020 in the WOS (Web of Science) database were included in the present study. Based on the well-recognized Technology-based Learning Review model, several dimensions, such as research methods, research sample groups, adopted technology, language skills, the role of AI in language education, and learning outcomes, were taken into account. The review results show that the main application domains of AILEd research were writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In terms of applied technology and algorithms, AI in language education mostly adopted ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System) and NLP (Natural Language Processing). Besides, several commonly used AI algorithms were Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Parsing. It was also found that some research focused on learning anxiety, willingness to communicate, knowledge acquisition, and classroom interaction. However, higher order thinking, complex problem solving, critical thinking ability, and collaborative learning tendencies were rarely considered in AILEd studies. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided to researchers, teachers, and decision makers for applying or studying AI applications in language education in the future. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Background: More than 17 million people worldwide, including 360,000 people in the United Kingdom, were diagnosed with cancer in 2018. Cancer prognosis and disease burden are highly dependent on the disease stage at diagnosis. Most people diagnosed with cancer first present in primary care settings, where improved assessment of the (often vague) presenting symptoms of cancer could lead to earlier detection and improved outcomes for patients. There is accumulating evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist clinicians in making better clinical decisions in some areas of health care. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review AI techniques that may facilitate earlier diagnosis of cancer and could be applied to primary care electronic health record (EHR) data. The quality of the evidence, the phase of development the AI techniques have reached, the gaps that exist in the evidence, and the potential for use in primary care were evaluated. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases from January 01, 2000, to June 11, 2019, and included all studies providing evidence for the accuracy or effectiveness of applying AI techniques for the early detection of cancer, which may be applicable to primary care EHRs. We included all study designs in all settings and languages. These searches were extended through a scoping review of AI-based commercial technologies. The main outcomes assessed were measures of diagnostic accuracy for cancer. Results: We identified 10,456 studies; 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing the data of 3,862,910 patients. A total of 13 studies described the initial development and testing of AI algorithms, and 3 studies described the validation of an AI algorithm in independent data sets. One study was based on prospectively collected data; only 3 studies were based on primary care data. We found no data on implementation barriers or cost-effectiveness. Risk of bias assessment highlighted a wide range of study quality. The additional scoping review of commercial AI technologies identified 21 technologies, only 1 meeting our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not undertaken because of the heterogeneity of AI modalities, data set characteristics, and outcome measures. Conclusions: AI techniques have been applied to EHR-type data to facilitate early diagnosis of cancer, but their use in primary care settings is still at an early stage of maturity. Further evidence is needed on their performance using primary care data, implementation barriers, and cost-effectiveness before widespread adoption into routine primary care clinical practice can be recommended. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Background: Invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a standard indicator of coronary stenoses’ hemodynamic severity. Clinical prediction models (CPMs) may help differentiate ischemic from non-ischemic lesions without using a pressure wire but by integrating related variables. This approach differs from that of physics-based models. However, it is not yet known which CPMs are the most reliable at detecting hemodynamic significance. Methods: A systematic review was performed of relevant publications that developed or validated any FFR CPMs from inception to April 2019 in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases by two independent authors. The risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the prediction model risk of the bias assessment tool (PROBAST). Results: A total of 11 unique CPMs and 5 subsequent external validation studies were identified. The prevalence of hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤0.80) across the studies had a median of 37.1% (range: 20.7–68.0%). Lesion length, percent diameter stenosis, and minimal lumen diameter were the three most frequently used variables in the CPMs. Of the 11 FFR CPMs, 9 (82%) exhibited strong discrimination [area under the curve (AUC) >0.75], and 5 (45%) had been subject to external validation; however, calibration was only available for 3 models (27%). There was a high degree of applicability; however, none of the studies was assessed as having a low risk of bias. A CPM was identified that had undergone rigorous validation and calibration: the DILEMMA score (three validations; median AUC, 0.83). Conclusions: Almost half of the existing FFR CPMs had been externally validated. Due to their good discrimination abilities, these FFR CPMs are useful tools that could reduce the need for invasive hemodynamic measurements. Future research that adheres to methodological guidelines should be undertaken to develop high-quality models in this setting.

  abstract={Objective: The partnership between humans and machines can enhance clinical decisions accuracy, leading to improved patient outcomes. Despite this, the application of machine learning techniques in the healthcare sector, particularly in guiding heart failure patient management, remains unpopular. This systematic review aims to identify factors restricting the integration of machine learning derived risk scores into clinical practice when treating adults with acute and chronic heart failure. Methods: Four academic research databases and Google Scholar were searched to identify original research studies where heart failure patient data was used to build models predicting all-cause mortality, cardiac death, all-cause and heart failure-related hospitalization. Results: Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies' sample size ranged between 71 and 716 790 patients, and the median age was 72.1 (interquartile range: 61.1–76.8) years. The minimum and maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for models predicting mortality were 0.48 and 0.92, respectively. Models predicting hospitalization had an AUC of 0.47 to 0.84. Nineteen studies (63%) used logistic regression, 53% random forests, and 37% of studies used decision trees to build predictive models. None of the models were built or externally validated using data originating from Africa or the Middle-East. Conclusions: The variation in the aetiologies of heart failure, limited access to structured health data, distrust in machine learning techniques among clinicians and the modest accuracy of existing predictive models are some of the factors precluding the widespread use of machine learning derived risk calculators. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract={Introduction Experts agree that male involvement in maternal health is a multifaceted concept, but a robust assessment is lacking, hampering interpretation of the literature. This systematic review aims to examine the conceptualisation of male involvement in maternal health globally and review commonly used indicators. Methods PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched for quantitative literature (between the years 2000 and 2020) containing indicators representing male involvement in maternal health, which was defined as the involvement, participation, engagement or support of men in all activities related to maternal health. Results After full-Text review, 282 studies were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in Africa (43%), followed by North America (23%), Asia (15%) and Europe (12%). Descriptive and text mining analysis showed male involvement has been conceptualised by focusing on two main aspects: psychosocial support and instrumental support for maternal health care utilisation. Differences in measurement and topics were noted according to continent with Africa focusing on HIV prevention, North America and Europe on psychosocial health and stress, and Asia on nutrition. One-Third of studies used one single indicator and no common pattern of indicators could be identified. Antenatal care attendance was the most used indicator (40%), followed by financial support (17%), presence during childbirth (17%) and HIV testing (14%). Majority of studies did not collect data from men directly. Discussion Researchers often focus on a single aspect of male involvement, resulting in a narrow set of indicators. Aspects such as communication, shared decision making and the subjective feeling of support have received little attention. We believe a broader holistic scope can broaden the potential of male involvement programmes and stimulate a gender-Transformative approach. Further research is recommended to develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators for assessing male involvement in maternal health.  © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In times of Big Data and rapid changes, managers become increasingly reliant on dashboards to make fast and informed decisions. The advantages of dashboards are evident even at the beginning of Business Intelligence deployment in organizations. To address the inability of humans to deal with large amounts of data, dashboards are a typical instrument to represent business-critical information in a comprehensible manner. However, there are many difficulties in managing the needs of individuals, teams, and organizations together with the technology in the context of socio-technical systems. While a broad range of technologies for dashboards' creation exists, the question remains in how far dashboard solutions consider the needs and preferences of their primary addressee - human worker. This paper addresses this question by offering a systematic review of recent literature on dashboards. The study focuses on the end-user perspective and includes domains, goals, design process and dashboard characteristics, technologies, and impacts of dashboards' application in organizations. In conclusion, research gaps and potential directions are summarized. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved},

  abstract={The field of precision medicine explores disease treatments by looking at genetic, socio-environmental, and clinical factors, thus trying to provide a holistic view of a person's health. Public health, on the other hand, is focused on improving the health of populations through preventive strategies and timely interventions. With recent advances in technology, we are able to collect, analyze and store for the first-time large volumes of real-time, diverse and continuous health data. Typically, the field of precision medicine deals with a huge amount of data from few individuals; public health, on the other hand, deals with limited data from a population. With the coming of Big Data, the fields of precision medicine and public health are converging into precision public health, the study of biological and genetic factors supported by large amounts of population data. In this paper, we explore through a comprehensive review the data types and use cases found in precision medicine and public health. We also discuss how these data types and use cases can converge toward precision public health, as well as challenges and opportunities provided by research and analyses of health data. © Copyright © 2021 Velmovitsky, Bevilacqua, Alencar, Cowan and Morita.},

  abstract={Background: Increasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets. Objective: This article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed. Materials and methods: We conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research. Results: There are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models. Discussion: Machine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objective: To conduct a systematic review identifying workplace interventions that mitigate physician burnout related to the digital environment including health information technologies (eg, electronic health records) and decision support systems) with or without the application of advanced analytics for clinical care. Materials and Methods: Literature published from January 1, 2007 to June 3, 2020 was systematically reviewed from multiple databases and hand searches. Subgroup analysis identified relevant physician burnout studies with interventions examining digital tool burden, related workflow inefficiencies, and measures of burnout, stress, or job satisfaction in all practice settings. Results: The search strategy identified 4806 citations of which 81 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight studies reported interventions to decrease digital tool burden. Sixty-eight percent of these studies reported improvement in burnout and/or its proxy measures. Burnout was decreased by interventions that optimized technologies (primarily electronic health records), provided training, reduced documentation and task time, expanded the care team, and leveraged quality improvement processes in workflows. Discussion: The contribution of digital tools to physician burnout can be mitigated by careful examination of usability, introducing technologies to save or optimize time, and applying quality improvement to workflows. Conclusion: Physician burnout is not reduced by technology implementation but can be mitigated by technology and workflow optimization, training, team expansion, and careful consideration of factors affecting burnout, including specialty, practice setting, regulatory pressures, and how physicians spend their time.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

AI holds great promise in terms of beneficial, accurate and effective preventive and curative interventions. At the same time, there is also concerns regarding potential risks, harm and trust issues arising from the opacity of some AI algorithms because of their un-explainability. Overall, how can the decisions from these AI-based systems be trusted if the decision-making logic cannot be properly explained? Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to shed light to these questions. We study the recent development on this topic within the medical domain.

  abstract={Industry 4.0 comprises the application of different technological solutions so that business processes throughout the production chain are integrated. The supplier's selection, considering the industry 4.0 requirements, is essential in promoting collaborative strategies between suppliers and manufacturers. In this context, this study presents a systematic literature review about quantitative models to support supplier selection in the industry 4.0 era. Fourteen studies were reviewed and characterized in different perspectives such as modelling, application, and validation of the decision model. The results revealed that most of the decision models were developed combining multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among the criteria related to the Industry 4.0 environment, the most frequent ones were information sharing, technological capacity, digital collaboration and engagement. The gathered results can be useful to guide researchers and managers in the development of computational tools to assist decision-making processes for supplier selection in Industry 4.0 era. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: Early prediction of students’ learning performance using data mining techniques is an important topic these days. The purpose of this literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research in that area. Method: We conducted a literature review following a two-step procedure, looking for papers using the major search engines and selection based on certain criteria. Results: The document search process yielded 133 results, 82 of which were selected in order to answer some essential research questions in the area. The selected papers were grouped and described by the type of educational systems, the data mining techniques applied, the variables or features used, and how early accurate prediction was possible. Conclusions: Most of the papers analyzed were about online learning systems and traditional face-to-face learning in secondary and tertiary education; the most commonly-used predictive algorithms were J48, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes (classification), and logistic and linear regression (regression). The most important factors in early prediction were related to student assessment and data obtained from student interaction with Learning Management Systems. Finally, how early it was possible to make predictions depended on the type of educational system. © 2021 Psicothema.},

  abstract={Objective: The study sought to describe the prevalence and nature of clinical expert involvement in the development, evaluation, and implementation of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that utilize machine learning to analyze electronic health record data to assist nurses and physicians in prognostic and treatment decision making (ie, predictive CDSSs) in the hospital. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore and hand-searching of relevant conference proceedings were conducted to identify eligible articles. Empirical studies of predictive CDSSs using electronic health record data for nurses or physicians in the hospital setting published in the last 5 years in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings were eligible for synthesis. Data from eligible studies regarding clinician involvement, stage in system design, predictive CDSS intention, and target clinician were charted and summarized. Results: Eighty studies met eligibility criteria. Clinical expert involvement was most prevalent at the beginning and late stages of system design. Most articles (95%) described developing and evaluating machine learning models, 28% of which described involving clinical experts, with nearly half functioning to verify the clinical correctness or relevance of the model (47%). Discussion: Involvement of clinical experts in predictive CDSS design should be explicitly reported in publications and evaluated for the potential to overcome predictive CDSS adoption challenges. Conclusions: If present, clinical expert involvement is most prevalent when predictive CDSS specifications are made or when system implementations are evaluated. However, clinical experts are less prevalent in developmental stages to verify clinical correctness, select model features, preprocess data, or serve as a gold standard.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2021.

  abstract={Aims: This study aimed to review the performance of machine learning (ML) methods compared with conventional statistical models (CSMs) for predicting readmission and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) and to present an approach to formally evaluate the quality of studies using ML algorithms for prediction modelling. Methods and results: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search using MEDLINE, EPUB, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, INSPEC, ACM Library, and Web of Science. Eligible studies included primary research articles published between January 2000 and July 2020 comparing ML and CSMs in mortality and readmission prognosis of initially hospitalized HF patients. Data were extracted and analysed by two independent reviewers. A modified CHARMS checklist was developed in consultation with ML and biostatistics experts for quality assessment and was utilized to evaluate studies for risk of bias. Of 4322 articles identified and screened by two independent reviewers, 172 were deemed eligible for a full-text review. The final set comprised 20 articles and 686 842 patients. ML methods included random forests (n = 11), decision trees (n = 5), regression trees (n = 3), support vector machines (n = 9), neural networks (n = 12), and Bayesian techniques (n = 3). CSMs included logistic regression (n = 16), Cox regression (n = 3), or Poisson regression (n = 3). In 15 studies, readmission was examined at multiple time points ranging from 30 to 180 day readmission, with the majority of studies (n = 12) presenting prediction models for 30 day readmission outcomes. Of a total of 21 time-point comparisons, ML-derived c-indices were higher than CSM-derived c-indices in 16 of the 21 comparisons. In seven studies, mortality was examined at 9 time points ranging from in-hospital mortality to 1 year survival; of these nine, seven reported higher c-indices using ML. Two of these seven studies reported survival analyses utilizing random survival forests in their ML prediction models. Both reported higher c-indices when using ML compared with CSMs. A limitation of studies using ML techniques was that the majority were not externally validated, and calibration was rarely assessed. In the only study that was externally validated in a separate dataset, ML was superior to CSMs (c-indices 0.913 vs. 0.835). Conclusions: ML algorithms had better discrimination than CSMs in most studies aiming to predict risk of readmission and mortality in HF patients. Based on our review, there is a need for external validation of ML-based studies of prediction modelling. We suggest that ML-based studies should also be evaluated using clinical quality standards for prognosis research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020134867. ©2020 The Authors.

  abstract={Importance: An increasing number of machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are described in the medical literature, but this research focuses almost entirely on comparing CDSS directly with clinicians (human vs computer). Little is known about the outcomes of these systems when used as adjuncts to human decision-making (human vs human with computer). Objectives: To conduct a systematic review to investigate the association between the interactive use of ML-based diagnostic CDSSs and clinician performance and to examine the extent of the CDSSs' human factors evaluation. Evidence Review: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and grey literature was conducted for the period between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2019. Peer-reviewed studies published in English comparing human clinician performance with and without interactive use of an ML-based diagnostic CDSSs were included. All metrics used to assess human performance were considered as outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies-Intervention (ROBINS-I). Narrative summaries were produced for the main outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of medical conditions, outcomes of interest, and evaluation metrics, no meta-analysis was performed. Findings: A total of 8112 studies were initially retrieved and 5154 abstracts were screened; of these, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The median number of participating clinicians was 4 (interquartile range, 3-8). Of the 107 results that reported statistical significance, 54 (50%) were increased by the use of CDSSs, 4 (4%) were decreased, and 49 (46%) showed no change or an unclear change. In the subgroup of studies carried out in representative clinical settings, no association between the use of ML-based diagnostic CDSSs and improved clinician performance could be observed. Interobserver agreement was the commonly reported outcome whose change was the most strongly associated with CDSS use. Four studies (11%) reported on user feedback, and, in all but 1 case, clinicians decided to override at least some of the algorithms' recommendations. Twenty-eight studies (76%) were rated as having a high risk of bias in at least 1 of the 4 QUADAS-2 core domains, and 6 studies (16%) were considered to be at serious or critical risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found only sparse evidence that the use of ML-based CDSSs is associated with improved clinician diagnostic performance. Most studies had a low number of participants, were at high or unclear risk of bias, and showed little or no consideration for human factors. Caution should be exercised when estimating the current potential of ML to improve human diagnostic performance, and more comprehensive evaluation should be conducted before deploying ML-based CDSSs in clinical settings. The results highlight the importance of considering supported human decisions as end points rather than merely the stand-alone CDSSs outputs.. © 2021 Laser Institute of America.

  abstract={In recent years, the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) in data processing and model analysis have emerged in the medical field, enabled by computer technology developments and the integration of multiple disciplines. The application of AI in the medical field has gradually deepened and broadened. Among them, the development of clinical medicine intelligent decision-making is the fastest. The advantage of clinical medicine intelligent decision-making is to make the diagnosis faster and more accurate on the basis of certain information. Urine detection technologies, such as urine proteomics, urine metabolomics, and urine RNomics, have developed rapidly with the advancements in omics and medical tests. Advances in urine testing have made it possible to obtain a wealth of information from easily accessible urine. However, it has always been a problem to extract effective information from this information and use it. AI technology provides the possibility to process and use the information in urine. AI, combined with urine detection, not only provides new possibilities for precise and individual diagnosis and disease treatment, but also helps promote non-invasive diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the research and applications of AI combined with urine detection for disease diagnosis and treatment and discusses its existing problems and future development. © Translational Andrology and Urology.

  abstract={Background: Rapid diagnosing is crucial for controlling malaria. Various studies have aimed at developing machine learning models to diagnose malaria using blood smear images; however, this approach has many limitations. This study developed a machine learning model for malaria diagnosis using patient information. Methods: To construct datasets, we extracted patient information from the PubMed abstracts from 1956 to 2019. We used two datasets: a solely parasitic disease dataset and total dataset by adding information about other diseases. We compared six machine learning models: support vector machine, random forest (RF), multilayered perceptron, AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), and CatBoost. In addition, a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to address the data imbalance problem. Results: Concerning the solely parasitic disease dataset, RF was found to be the best model regardless of using SMOTE. Concerning the total dataset, GB was found to be the best. However, after applying SMOTE, RF performed the best. Considering the imbalanced data, nationality was found to be the most important feature in malaria prediction. In case of the balanced data with SMOTE, the most important feature was symptom. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to predict malaria using patient information. © 2020},

  abstract={Recently, electroencephalogram-based emotion recognition has become crucial in enabling the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system to become more intelligent. Due to the outstanding applications of emotion recognition, e.g., person-based decision making, mind-machine interfacing, cognitive interaction, affect detection, feeling detection, etc., emotion recognition has become successful in attracting the recent hype of AI-empowered research. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted driven by a range of approaches, which demand a systematic review of methodologies used for this task with their feature sets and techniques. It will facilitate the beginners as guidance towards composing an effective emotion recognition system. In this article, we have conducted a rigorous review on the state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems, published in recent literature, and summarized some of the common emotion recognition steps with relevant definitions, theories, and analyses to provide key knowledge to develop a proper framework. Moreover, studies included here were dichotomized based on two categories: i) deep learning-based, and ii) shallow machine learning-based emotion recognition systems. The reviewed systems were compared based on methods, classifier, the number of classified emotions, accuracy, and dataset used. An informative comparison, recent research trends, and some recommendations are also provided for future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: For most digital health applications (DiGA) only limited evidence of benefit is available. Currently available assessment frameworks do not cover all domains of a full health technology assessment (HTA). Additionally, technology-specific aspects are required for the evaluation of DiGA. This work aimed to analyze the available assessment frameworks and design an evaluation process for DiGA. Methods: By a systematic literature search six assessment frameworks for DiGA were selected and analyzed. A hand search for strategies on DiGA of selected countries was conducted. Results: Of the analyzed assessment frameworks four described study designs. One assessment framework proposed a risk classification of DiGA. Aspects of artificial intelligence were assessed by one assessment framework. The analyzed countries have differing strategies for reimbursement of DiGA. Conclusion: Assessment frameworks for DiGA are very heterogeneous. There are efforts to find regulations for DiGA on a national level. When evaluating DiGA, a staged approach considering risk classes with subsequent evaluation of relevant HTA aspects is recommended. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={In this study, we review 1830 research articles on artificial intelligence in education (AIED), with the aim of providing a holistic picture of the knowledge evolution in this interdisciplinary research field from 2010 to 2019. A novel three-step approach in the analysis of the keyword co-occurrence networks (KCN) is proposed to identify the knowledge structure, knowledge clusters and trending keywords within AIED over time. The results reveal considerable research diversity in the AIED field, centering around two sustained themes: intelligent tutoring systems (2010-19) and massive open online courses (since 2014). The focal educational concerns reflected in AIED research are: (1) online learning; (2) game-based learning; (3) collaborative learning; (4) assessment; (5) affect; (6) engagement; and (7) learning design. The highly connected keywords relevant to analytic techniques within this field include natural language processing, educational data mining, learning analytics and machine learning. Neural network, deep learning, eye tracking, and personalized learning are trending keywords in this field as they have emerged with key structural roles in the latest two-year period analyzed. This is the first article providing a systematic review of a large body of literature on artificial intelligence in education, and in it we uncover the underlying patterns of knowledge connectivity within the field, as well as provide insight into its future development. The three-step multi-scale (macro, meso, micro) framework proposed in this study can also be applied to map the knowledge development in other scientific research areas. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.},

  abstract={Background: Oral cancer can show heterogenous patterns of behavior. For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Objectives: This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice. Data sources: We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC. Eligibility criteria: Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered. Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations. Conclusion: Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Respiratory diseases reach one of the main systems of the human body and affect a large part of the Brazilian population. In severe cases, they can limit the functionalities and the muscular strength of the disease carriers, decreasing their quality of life, because of the impact on simple daily activities. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs help to treat these diseases. The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program of Feevale University helps patients with chronic respiratory diseases in the community and aims to improve their quality of life through the development of educational and assistance actions. The information about the patients and the treatment results are stored in a database. The amount of data disturbs the analysis of results. Through of a systematic review, it was possible to see that does not exist a model to predict abandonment trends of patients in Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs. Therefore, this paper proposes a model to apply machine learning techniques in the database of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program of Feevale University. The model aims to identify the abandonment trends of patients entering the treatment and to extract knowledge about this database to contribute to the application of pulmonary rehabilitation treatment. In addition, this paper presents the development of a tool to apply the model proposed and provides visualizations to assist reading the data and results by healthcare professionals. The Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest techniques were compared. A predictive model created with the Random Forest technique demonstrated the best performance in the abandonment predictions, reaching 69.82% of accuracy. Thus, it is possible to use machine learning to predict abandonment trends of patients in Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs. © 2020 ACM.},

  abstract={Data breaches in healthcare continue to grow exponentially, calling for a rethinking into better approaches of security measures towards mitigating the menace. Traditional approaches including technological measures, have significantly contributed to mitigating data breaches but what is still lacking is the development of the “human firewall,” which is the conscious care security practices of the insiders. As a result, the healthcare security practice analysis, modeling and incentivization project (HSPAMI) is geared towards analyzing healthcare staffs’ security practices in various scenarios including big data. The intention is to determine the gap between staffs’ security practices and required security practices for incentivization measures. To address the state-of-the art, a systematic review was conducted to pinpoint appropriate AI methods and data sources that can be used for effective studies. Out of about 130 articles, which were initially identified in the context of human-generated healthcare data for security measures in healthcare, 15 articles were found to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included article reveals that, KNN, Bayesian Network and Decision Trees (C4.5) algorithms were mostly applied on Electronic Health Records (EHR) Logs and Network logs with varying input features of healthcare staffs’ security practices. What was found challenging is the performance scores of these algorithms which were not sufficiently outlined in the existing studies. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={Objective: The development of machine learning (ML) algorithms to address a variety of issues faced in clinical practice has increased rapidly. However, questions have arisen regarding biases in their development that can affect their applicability in specific populations. We sought to evaluate whether studies developing ML models from electronic health record (EHR) data report sufficient demographic data on the study populations to demonstrate representativeness and reproducibility. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed for articles applying ML models to improve clinical decision-making using EHR data. We limited our search to papers published between 2015 and 2019. Results: Across the 164 studies reviewed, demographic variables were inconsistently reported and/or included as model inputs. Race/ethnicity was not reported in 64%; gender and age were not reported in 24% and 21% of studies, respectively. Socioeconomic status of the population was not reported in 92% of studies. Studies that mentioned these variables often did not report if they were included as model inputs. Few models (12%) were validated using external populations. Few studies (17%) open-sourced their code. Populations in the ML studies include higher proportions of White and Black yet fewer Hispanic subjects compared to the general US population. Discussion: The demographic characteristics of study populations are poorly reported in the ML literature based on EHR data. Demographic representativeness in training data and model transparency is necessary to ensure that ML models are deployed in an equitable and reproducible manner. Wider adoption of reporting guidelines is warranted to improve representativeness and reproducibility. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract={Bladder cancer (BC) is the 10th most common cancer worldwide. Approximately one quarter of patients with BC have muscle-invasive disease (MIBC). Muscle-invasive disease carries a poor prognosis and choosing the optimal treatment option is critical to improve patients’ outcomes. Ongoing research supports the role of 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) in guiding patient-specific management decisions throughout the course of MIBC. As an imaging modality, 18F-FDG PET is acquired simultaneously with either computed tomography (CT) or MRI to offer a hybrid approach combining anatomical and metabolic information that complement each other. At initial staging, 18F-FDG PET/CT enhances the detection of extravesical disease, particularly in patients classified as oligometastatic by conventional imaging. 18F-FDG PET/CT has value in monitoring response to neoadjuvant and systemic chemotherapy, as well as in localizing relapse after treatment. In the new era of immunotherapy, 18F-FDG PET/CT may also be useful to monitor treatment efficacy as well as to detect immune-related adverse events. With the advent of artificial intelligence techniques such as radiomics and deep learning, these hybrid medical images can be mined for quantitative data, providing incremental value over current standard-of-care clinical and biological data. This approach has the potential to produce a major paradigm shift toward data-driven precision medicine with the ultimate goal of personalized medicine. In this review, we highlight current literature reporting the role of 18F-FDG PET in supporting personalized management decisions for patients with MIBC. Specific topics reviewed include the incremental value of 18F-FDG PET in prognostication, pre-operative planning, response assessment, prediction of recurrence, and diagnosing drug toxicity. © Copyright © 2020 Girard, Vila Reyes, Shaish, Grellier, Dercle, Salaün, Delcroix and Rouanne.},

  abstract={Objective: We aimed to identify machine learning (ML) models for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prediction in community settings and determine their predictive performance. Method: Systematic review of ML predictive modelling studies in 13 databases since 2009 was conducted. Primary outcomes included metrics of discrimination, calibration, and classification. Secondary outcomes included important variables, level of validation, and intended use of models. Meta-analysis of c-indices, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, publication bias assessments and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Twenty-three studies (40 prediction models) were included. Studies with high-, moderate-, and low- risk of bias were 3, 14, and 6 respectively. All studies conducted internal validation whereas none conducted external validation of their models. Twenty studies provided classification metrics to varying extents whereas only 7 studies performed model calibration. Eighteen studies reported information on both the variables used for model development and the feature importance. Twelve studies highlighted potential applicability of their models for T2DM screening. Meta-analysis produced a good pooled c-index (0.812). Sources of heterogeneity were identified through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Issues pertaining to methodological quality and reporting were observed. Conclusions: We found evidence of good performance of ML models for T2DM prediction in the community. Improvements to methodology, reporting and validation are needed before they can be used at scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms learning patterns in large, complex datasets to predict and classify. Algorithms include neural networks (NN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). ML may generate substantial improvements in neurosurgery. This systematic review assessed the current state of neurosurgical ML applications and the performance of algorithms applied. Our systematic search strategy yielded 6866 results, 70 of which met inclusion criteria. Performance statistics analyzed included area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation, planning, and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN, LR, and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy (F(2,19) = 6.56, p < 0.01) and specificity (F(2,16) = 5.57, p < 0.01) of NN, LR, and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN, LR, and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics, which were defined by modeling approach, surgery type, and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future neurosurgical ML research. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Telemedicine has the potential to improve patient care and management for various chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. To ensure the success of any telemedicine program, there is a need to understand the patients’ satisfaction and their preferences. This review aims to collate and provide evidence related to practices that may influence the performance of telemedicine for patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We searched three electronic databases for studies examining patients’ satisfaction and preferences for using telemedicine in type 2 diabetes. An evaluation matrix was developed to collect the data from the included articles. A total of 20 articles were identified and data on the key outcomes identified were narratively synthesized. Results: Patients were generally satisfied with the use of telemedicine for management of type 2 diabetes. Users reported that telemedicine was beneficial as it provided constant monitoring, improved access to healthcare providers, and reduced waiting time. When adopting a telemedicine platform, most patients expressed preference for mobile health (mHealth) as the telemedicine modality, especially if it has been endorsed by their physician. To improve usability and sustainability, patients suggested that modules related to diabetes education be enhanced, together with sufficient technical and physician support when adopting telemedicine. Patients also expressed the importance of having a sufficiently flexible platform that could be adapted to their needs. Conclusion: Personalized telemedicine strategies coupled with appropriate physician endor-sement greatly influences a patient’s decision to undertake telemedicine. Future work should focus on improving telemedicine infrastructure and increasing physician’s involvement, especially during the implementation phase. © 2021 Sim and Lee.},

Full texts of the relevant articles were reviewed by the first author and approved by the second reviewer, accompanied by the screening of articles’ references. The details of design, implementation and evaluation of included CDSSs were extracted. Results: Our search returned 3427 articles, 53 of which describing 25 CDSSs were selected. We identified 8 expert-based and 17 data-driven tools. Sixteen (64%) tools were developed in the United States, with the others mostly in Europe. Most of the tools (n ¼ 16, 64%) were implemented in 1 site, with only 5 being actively used in clinical practice. Patient or quality outcomes were assessed for 3 (18%) CDSSs, 4 (16%) underwent user acceptance or usage testing and 7 (28%) functional testing. Conclusions: We found a number of CDSSs that generate new knowledge, although only 1 addressed confounding and bias. Overall, the tools lacked demonstration of their utility. Improvement in clinical and quality outcomes were shown only for a few CDSSs, while the benefits of the others remain unclear. This review suggests a need for a further testing of such CDSSs and, if appropriate, their dissemination. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract={Background/purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made deep inroads into dentistry in the last few years. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the development of AI applications that are widely employed in dentistry and evaluate their performance in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and predicting the prognosis of the treatment. Materials and methods: The literature for this paper was identified and selected by performing a thorough search in the electronic data bases like PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science, and Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000–March 15, 2020).After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. Quality analysis was performed using QUADAS-2. Results: AI technologies are widely implemented in a wide range of dentistry specialties. Most of the documented work is focused on AI models that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AI models have been used in detection and diagnosis of dental caries, vertical root fractures, apical lesions, salivary gland diseases, maxillary sinusitis, maxillofacial cysts, cervical lymph nodes metastasis, osteoporosis, cancerous lesions, alveolar bone loss, predicting orthodontic extractions, need for orthodontic treatments, cephalometric analysis, age and gender determination. Conclusion: These studies indicate that the performance of an AI based automated system is excellent. They mimic the precision and accuracy of trained specialists, in some studies it was found that these systems were even able to outmatch dental specialists in terms of performance and accuracy. © 2020 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China},

  abstract={Objective. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the quality and outcome of studies into artificial intelligence techniques, analysis, and effect in dentistry. Materials and Methods. Using the MeSH keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), dentistry, AI in dentistry, neural networks and dentistry, machine learning, AI dental imaging, and AI treatment recommendations and dentistry. Two investigators performed an electronic search in 5 databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Scopus (Elsevier), ScienceDirect databases (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and the Cochrane Collaboration (Wiley). The English language articles reporting on AI in different dental specialties were screened for eligibility. Thirty-two full-text articles were selected and systematically analyzed according to a predefined inclusion criterion. These articles were analyzed as per a specific research question, and the relevant data based on article general characteristics, study and control groups, assessment methods, outcomes, and quality assessment were extracted. Results. The initial search identified 175 articles related to AI in dentistry based on the title and abstracts. The full text of 38 articles was assessed for eligibility to exclude studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Six articles not related to AI in dentistry were excluded. Thirty-two articles were included in the systematic review. It was revealed that AI provides accurate patient management, dental diagnosis, prediction, and decision making. Artificial intelligence appeared as a reliable modality to enhance future implications in the various fields of dentistry, i.e., diagnostic dentistry, patient management, head and neck cancer, restorative dentistry, prosthetic dental sciences, orthodontics, radiology, and periodontics. Conclusion. The included studies describe that AI is a reliable tool to make dental care smooth, better, time-saving, and economical for practitioners. AI benefits them in fulfilling patient demand and expectations. The dentists can use AI to ensure quality treatment, better oral health care outcome, and achieve precision. AI can help to predict failures in clinical scenarios and depict reliable solutions. However, AI is increasing the scope of state-of-the-art models in dentistry but is still under development. Further studies are required to assess the clinical performance of AI techniques in dentistry.  © 2021 Naseer Ahmed et al.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) when coupled with large amounts of well characterised data can yield models that are expected to facilitate clinical practice and contribute to the delivery of better care, especially in chronic diseases such as asthma. The purpose of this paper is to review the utilisation of AI techniques in all aspects of asthma research, i.e. from asthma screening and diagnosis, to patient classification and the overall asthma management and treatment, in order to identify trends, draw conclusions and discover potential gaps in the literature. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed and DBLP from 1988 up to 2019, yielding 425 articles; after removing duplicate and irrelevant articles, 98 were further selected for detailed review. The resulting articles were organised in four categories, and subsequently compared based on a set of qualitative and quantitative factors. Overall, we observed an increasing adoption of AI techniques for asthma research, especially within the last decade. AI is a scientific field that is in the spotlight, especially the last decade. In asthma there are already numerous studies; however, there are certain unmet needs that need to be further elucidated. Copyright ©ERS 2020},

  abstract={Objective: In recent years numerous studies have achieved promising results in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using automatic language processing. We systematically review these articles to understand the effectiveness of this approach, identify any issues and report the main findings that can guide further research. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved? Results and Discussion: We identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants' demographic variables (especially age) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups. Conclusion: The systematic literature review supported the argument that language and speech could successfully be used to detect dementia automatically. Future studies should aim for larger and more balanced datasets, combine data collection methods and the type of information analyzed, focus on the early stages of the disease, and report performance using standardized metrics.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract={This article aims to provide a thorough overview of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in studying the gut microbiota and its role in the diagnosis and treatment of some important diseases. The association between microbiota and diseases, together with its clinical relevance, is still difficult to interpret. The advances in AI techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), can help clinicians in processing and interpreting these massive data sets. Two research groups have been involved in this Scoping Review, working in two different areas of Europe: Florence and Sarajevo. The papers included in the review describe the use of ML or DL methods applied to the study of human gut microbiota. In total, 1109 papers were considered in this study. After elimination, a final set of 16 articles was considered in the scoping review. Different AI techniques were applied in the reviewed papers. Some papers applied ML, while others applied DL techniques. 11 papers evaluated just different ML algorithms (ranging from one to eight algorithms applied to one dataset). The remaining five papers examined both ML and DL algorithms. The most applied ML algorithm was Random Forest and it also exhibited the best performances. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Previous research has been exploring the user experiences, interface design, and production processes of journalistic products, and it is important to continue such discussions on how better Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and practices improve the production and consumption of news. Specifically, because of the development of Big Data and AI digital technologies, it is now vital to investigate how such technologies can be integrated into the HCI design for better user experience. With the aim to systematically examine digital journalism research fronts for better HCI, a scientometric study has been conducted by analyzing 2156 articles on digital journalism, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, so as to critically evaluate the extant literature investigating such relationship between HCI and digital journalism for future research directions. By analyzing major disciplines, core publications, keywords, and key authors’ ideas, this study found that the multidisciplinary knowledge surrounding digital journalism, especially top disciplines such as communication, computer science, information science & library science can be divided into four main categories: journalism and framing; interactivity; analytics and metrics; big data and transparency. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a better overall picture on the relationship between journalism and interaction design, thereby helping advancing both fields with preliminary but important findings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={The amount of home-based exercise prescribed by a physical therapist is difficult to monitor. However, the integration of wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices can aid in monitoring home exercise by analyzing exercise biomechanics. The objective of this study is to evaluate machine learning models for classifying nine different upper extremity exercises, based upon kinematic data captured from an IMU-based device. Fifty participants performed one compound and eight isolation exercises with their right arm. Each exercise was performed ten times for a total of 4500 trials. Joint angles were calculated using IMUs that were placed on the hand, forearm, upper arm, and torso. Various machine learning models were developed with different algorithms and train-test splits. Random forest models with flattened kinematic data as a feature had the greatest accuracy (98.6%). Using triaxial joint range of motion as the feature set resulted in decreased accuracy (91.9%) with faster speeds. Accuracy did not decrease below 90% until training size was decreased to 5% from 50%. Accuracy decreased (88.7%) when splitting data by participant. Upper extremity exercises can be classified accurately using kinematic data from a wearable IMU device. A random forest classification model was developed that quickly and accurately classified exercises. Sampling frequency and lower training splits had a modest effect on performance. When the data were split by subject stratification, larger training sizes were required for acceptable algorithm performance. These findings set the basis for more objective and accurate measurements of home-based exercise using emerging healthcare technologies. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Autoimmune diseases are chronic, multifactorial conditions. Through machine learning (ML), a branch of the wider field of artificial intelligence, it is possible to extract patterns within patient data, and exploit these patterns to predict patient outcomes for improved clinical management. Here, we surveyed the use of ML methods to address clinical problems in autoimmune disease. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases. Relevant papers included “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” and the autoimmune diseases search term(s) in their title, abstract or key words. Exclusion criteria: studies not written in English, no real human patient data included, publication prior to 2001, studies that were not peer reviewed, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers. 169 (of 702) studies met the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models. Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios (e.g. classification of cases and controls). Progression to more complex predictive models may be achievable in future through integration of multiple data types. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major branch of computer science that is fruitfully used for analyzing complex medical data and extracting meaningful relationships in datasets, for several clinical aims. Specifically, in the brain care domain, several innovative approaches have achieved remarkable results and open new perspectives in terms of diagnosis, planning, and outcome prediction. In this work, we present an overview of different artificial intelligent techniques used in the brain care domain, along with a review of important clinical applications. A systematic and careful literature search in major databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science was carried out using "artificial intelligence"and "brain"as main keywords. Further references were integrated by cross-referencing from key articles. 155 studies out of 2696 were identified, which actually made use of AI algorithms for different purposes (diagnosis, surgical treatment, intra-operative assistance, and postoperative assessment). Artificial neural networks have risen to prominent positions among the most widely used analytical tools. Classic machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and random forest are still widely used. Task-specific algorithms are designed for solving specific problems. Brain images are one of the most used data types. AI has the possibility to improve clinicians' decision-making ability in neuroscience applications. However, major issues still need to be addressed for a better practical use of AI in the brain. To this aim, it is important to both gather comprehensive data and build explainable AI algorithms.  © 2020 Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Colon cancer generally begins as a neoplastic growth of tissue, called po-lyps, originating from the inner lining of the colon wall. Most colon polyps are considered harm-less but over the time, they can evolve into colon cancer, which, when diagnosed in later stages, is often fatal. Hence, time is of the essence in the early detection of polyps and the prevention of colon cancer. Methods: To aid this endeavor, many computer-aided methods have been developed, which use a wide array of techniques to detect, localize and segment polyps from CT Colonography images. In this paper, a comprehensive state-of-the-art method is proposed and categorize this work broadly using the available classification techniques using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Conclusion: The performance of each of the proposed approach is analyzed with existing methods and also how they can be used to tackle the timely and accurate detection of colon polyps. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={Purpose of the Review: Over 100,000 cardiovascular-related deaths annually are caused by acute pulmonary embolism (PE). While anticoagulation has historically been the foundation for treatment of PE, this review highlights the recent rapid expansion in the interventional strategies for this condition. Recent Findings: At the time of diagnosis, appropriate risk stratification helps to accurately identify patients who may be candidates for advanced therapeutic interventions. While systemic thrombolytics (ST) is the mostly commonly utilized intervention for high-risk PE, the risk profile of ST for intermediate-risk PE limits its use. Assessment of an individualized patient risk profile, often via a multidisciplinary pulmonary response team (PERT) model, there are various interventional strategies to consider for PE management. Novel therapeutic options include catheter-directed thrombolysis, catheter-based embolectomy, or mechanical circulatory support for certain high-risk PE patients. Current data has established safety and efficacy for catheter-based treatment of PE based on surrogate outcome measures. However, there is limited long-term data or prospective comparisons between treatment modalities and ST. While PE diagnosis has improved with modern cross-sectional imaging, there is interest in improved diagnostic models for PE that incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Summary: In patients with acute pulmonary embolism, after appropriate risk stratification, some intermediate and high-risk patients should be considered for interventional-based treatment for PE. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Mental illnesses, such as depression, are highly prevalent and have been shown to impact an individual’s physical health. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to assist mental health providers, including psychiatrists and psychologists, for decision-making based on patients’ historical data (e.g., medical records, behavioral data, social media usage, etc.). Deep learning (DL), as one of the most recent generation of AI technologies, has demonstrated superior performance in many real-world applications ranging from computer vision to healthcare. The goal of this study is to review existing research on applications of DL algorithms in mental health outcome research. Specifically, we first briefly overview the state-of-the-art DL techniques. Then we review the literature relevant to DL applications in mental health outcomes. According to the application scenarios, we categorize these relevant articles into four groups: diagnosis and prognosis based on clinical data, analysis of genetics and genomics data for understanding mental health conditions, vocal and visual expression data analysis for disease detection, and estimation of risk of mental illness using social media data. Finally, we discuss challenges in using DL algorithms to improve our understanding of mental health conditions and suggest several promising directions for their applications in improving mental health diagnosis and treatment. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={We performed a systematic review of studies focusing on the automatic prediction of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and a quantitative analysis of the methodological choices impacting performance. This review included 172 articles, from which 234 experiments were extracted. For each of them, we reported the used data set, the feature types, the algorithm type, performance and potential methodological issues. The impact of these characteristics on the performance was evaluated using a multivariate mixed effect linear regressions. We found that using cognitive, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography or potentially electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography variables significantly improved predictive performance compared to not including them, whereas including other modalities, in particular T1 magnetic resonance imaging, did not show a significant effect. The good performance of cognitive assessments questions the wide use of imaging for predicting the progression to AD and advocates for exploring further fine domain-specific cognitive assessments. We also identified several methodological issues, including the absence of a test set, or its use for feature selection or parameter tuning in nearly a fourth of the papers. Other issues, found in 15% of the studies, cast doubts on the relevance of the method to clinical practice. We also highlight that short-term predictions are likely not to be better than predicting that subjects stay stable over time. These issues highlight the importance of adhering to good practices for the use of machine learning as a decision support system for the clinical practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background: Spoken word retrieval therapy forms an integral part of aphasia therapy. Due to the range of therapy options and variations, drawing clear-cut conclusions from the evidence base can be challenging. Aims: This paper consolidates recent findings (2008–2018), pertinent to spoken word-finding interventions. Specifically, we are interested in aphasia interventions: (1) that target single-word spoken naming; (2) whose participants are adults with acquired naming impairments after a stroke; and (3) whose treatment approach focusses on the use of language forms (i.e., semantics, phonology, and orthography). The over-arching objective is to determine the important therapy components underpinning successful single-word naming treatments. Methods and Procedures: A systematic literature search was conducted. This led to the compilation of a large-scale dataset (n=222 participants from 32 papers), with the heterogenous interventions dissected into their “active” therapy components. A detailed framework (“RITA”: (1) Regimen; (2) Item(s); (3) Technique(s); and (4) Application of technique(s) with their Adjuncts) was designed to organise these “active therapy ingredients”. Using random forest, we identified the crucial components responsible for the successful naming of treated and untreated items, respectively, at short-term and maintenance periods. Outcomes and Results: The role of the written form as therapeutic cues, presented either as a whole word or part-word, emerged to be a consistent and robust predictor, across the outcomes. Semantic tasks were useful in the successful naming of untreated items. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider using written prompts as part of spoken naming therapy. It is possible that the use of orthography underlies the success of multi-component techniques. Other clinical implications (e.g., homework, treatment intensity) are also discussed. In addition, we propose a comprehensive “RITA” framework, which summarises the “active” therapy components. “RITA” (available as a template in Appendix 3) is useful for clinicians and researchers as a guide to unpack language interventions. Furthermore, the paper highlights the strengths of a well-established method, random forest, as a valuable statistical tool to move aphasia research forward. Overall, the study refines our understanding of spoken naming treatment for those with aphasia, specifically individuals with word-finding deficits. Importantly, through the use of a robust statistical approach and an original framework designed to lay out language therapy components, the paper adds new clarity to the evidence base. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Objective: Much has been invested in big data analytics to improve health and reduce costs. However, it is unknown whether these investments have achieved the desired goals. We performed a scoping review to determine the health and economic impact of big data analytics for clinical decision-making. Materials and Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the National Health Services Economic Evaluations Database for relevant articles. We included peer-reviewed papers that report the health economic impact of analytics that assist clinical decision-making. We extracted the economic methods and estimated impact and also assessed the quality of the methods used. In addition, we estimated how many studies assessed “big data analytics” based on a broad definition of this term. Results: The search yielded 12 133 papers but only 71 studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria. Only a few papers were full economic evaluations; many were performed during development. Papers frequently reported savings for healthcare payers but only 20% also included costs of analytics. Twenty studies examined “big data analytics” and only 7 reported both cost-savings and better outcomes. Discussion: The promised potential of big data is not yet reflected in the literature, partly since only a few full and properly performed economic evaluations have been published. This and the lack of a clear definition of “big data” limit policy makers and healthcare professionals from determining which big data initiatives are worth implementing. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract={Data mining (DM) consists in analysing a set of observations to find unsuspected relationships and then summarising the data in new ways that are both understandable and useful. It has become widely used in various medical fields including breast cancer (BC), which is the most common cancer and the leading cause of death among women worldwide. BC diagnosis is a challenging medical task and many studies have attempted to apply classification techniques to it. The objective of the present study is to identify studies on classification techniques in BC diagnosis and to analyse them from three perspectives: classification techniques used, accuracy of the classifiers, and comparison of performance. We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of 176 selected studies published between January 2000 and November 2018. The results show that, of the nine classification techniques investigated, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees were the most frequently used. Moreover, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and ensemble classifiers performed better than the other techniques, with median accuracy values of 95%, 95% and 96% respectively. Most of the selected studies (57.4%) used datasets containing different types of images such as mammographic, ultrasound, and microarray images. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Learning is a natural human activity that is shaped by personal experiences, cognitive awareness, personal bias, opinions, cultural background, and environment. Learning has been defined as a stable and persistent change in what a person knows and can do. Learning is formed through an individual’s interactions, including the conveyance of knowledge and skills from others and experiences. So, learning is a personalized experience that allows one to expand their knowledge, perspective, skills, and understanding. Therefore, personalized learning models can help to meet individual needs and goals. Furthermore, to personalize the learning experience, technology integration can play a crucial role. This paper provides a review of the recent research literature on personalized learning as technology is changing how learning can be effectively personalized. The emphasis is on the terms used to characterize learning as those can suggest a framework for personalized and will eventually be used in meta-analyses of research on personalized learning, which is beyond the scope of this paper. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: The benefits of data and analytics for health care systems and single providers is an increasingly investigated field in digital health literature. Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. Objective: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. Methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. Results: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. Conclusions: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={While coronary angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is associated with procedural risk, it is an invasive technique requiring arterial puncture, and it subjects the patient to radiation and iodinated contrast exposure. Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a pretest probability of disease that can be used to triage patients for angiography. This review comprehensively investigates published papers in the domain of CAD detection using different AI techniques from 1991 to 2020, in order to discern broad trends and geographical differences. Moreover, key decision factors affecting CAD diagnosis are identified for different parts of the world by aggregating the results from different studies. In this study, all datasets that have been used for the studies for CAD detection, their properties, and achieved performances using various AI techniques, are presented, compared, and analyzed. In particular, the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to diagnose and predict CAD are reviewed. From PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search, 500 papers were selected to be investigated. Among these selected papers, 256 papers met our criteria and hence were included in this study. Our findings demonstrate that AI-based techniques have been increasingly applied for the detection of CAD since 2008. AI-based techniques that utilized electrocardiography (ECG), demographic characteristics, symptoms, physical examination findings, and heart rate signals, reported high accuracy for the detection of CAD. In these papers, the authors ranked the features based on their assessed clinical importance with ML techniques. The results demonstrate that the attribution of the relative importance of ML features for CAD diagnosis is different among countries. More recently, DL methods have yielded high CAD detection performance using ECG signals, which drives its burgeoning adoption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background and purpose — Advancements in software and hardware have enabled the rise of clinical prediction models based on machine learning (ML) in orthopedic surgery. Given their growing popularity and their likely implementation in clinical practice we evaluated which outcomes these new models have focused on and what methodologies are being employed. Material and methods — We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published up to June 18, 2020. Studies reporting on non-ML prediction models or non-orthopedic outcomes were excluded. After screening 7,138 studies, 59 studies reporting on 77 prediction models were included. We extracted data regarding outcome, study design, and reported performance metrics. Results — Of the 77 identified ML prediction models the most commonly reported outcome domain was medical management (17/77). Spinal surgery was the most commonly involved orthopedic subspecialty (28/77). The most frequently employed algorithm was neural networks (42/77). Median size of datasets was 5,507 (IQR 635–26,364). The median area under the curve (AUC) was 0.80 (IQR 0.73–0.86). Calibration was reported for 26 of the models and 14 provided decision-curve analysis. Interpretation — ML prediction models have been developed for a wide variety of topics in orthopedics. Topics regarding medical management were the most commonly studied. Heterogeneity between studies is based on study size, algorithm, and time-point of outcome. Calibration and decision-curve analysis were generally poorly reported. © 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract={With the rapid growth of technology, computer learning has become increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence techniques in order to develop more personalized educational systems. These systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed across different educational fields. The original studies from 2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer sciences (37.73%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96%, 22.64%, and 20.75% frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction, evaluate learners, define and update the learner’s model, and classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of the system, learner’s performance, and experiences were used for evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning in the learning process, these systems have rarely been applied in experimental courses including problem-solving, decision-making in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields. Due to the important role of a cell phone in facilitating personalized learning and given the low rate of using mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development and evaluation of mobile-based ITSs. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={Introduction: Accurate prognostic prediction of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is challenging but important for the emergency team and patient’s family members. A number of prognostic prediction models specifically designed for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are developed and validated worldwide. Objective: This narrative review provides an overview of the prognostic prediction models out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients for use in the emergency department. Discussion: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic prediction models are potentially useful in clinical, administrative and research settings. Development and validation of such models require prehospital and hospital predictor and outcome variables which are best in the standardised Utstein Style. Logistic regression analysis is traditionally employed for model development but machine learning is emerging as the new tool. Examples of such models available for use in the emergency department include ROSC After Cardiac Arrest, CaRdiac Arrest Survival Score, Utstein-Based Return of Spontaneous Circulation, Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest, Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis and Cardiac Arrest Survival Score. The usefulness of these models awaits future studies. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract={Big data have the potential to determine enhanced decision-making process and to personalize the approach of delivering care when applied in nursing science. So far, the literature on this topic is still not synthesized for the period between 2014 and 2018. Thus, this systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize the most recent evidence on big data application in nursing research. The systematic search was undertaken for the evidence published from January 2014 to May 2018, and the outputs were formatted using the PRISMA Flow Diagram, whereas the quality appraisal was addressed by recommendations consistent with the Critical Appraisal Skills Program. Twelve studies on big data in nursing were included and divided into two themes: the majority of the studies aimed to determine prediction assessment, while only four studies were related to the impact of big data applications to support clinical practice. This review tracks the recent state of knowledge on big data applications in nursing science, revealing the potential for nursing engagement in big data science, even if currently limited to some fields. Big data applications in nursing might have a tremendous potential impact, but are currently underused in research and clinical practice.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

  abstract={This systematic review analyses and describes the application and diagnostic accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods used for detection and grading of potentially malignant (pre-cancerous) and cancerous head and neck lesions using whole slide images (WSI) of human tissue slides. Electronic databases MEDLINE via OVID, Scopus and Web of Science were searched between October 2009 – April 2020. Tailored search-strings were developed using database-specific terms. Studies were selected using a strict inclusion criterion following PRISMA Guidelines. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using a tailored QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 315 records, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AI-based methods were employed for analysis of specific histological features for oral epithelial dysplasia (n = 1), oral submucous fibrosis (n = 5), oral squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). A combination of heuristics, supervised and unsupervised learning methods were employed, including more than 10 different classification and segmentation techniques. Most studies used uni-centric datasets (range 40–270 images) comprising small sub-images within WSI with accuracy between 79 and 100%. This review provides early evidence to support the potential application of supervised machine learning methods as a diagnostic aid for some oral potentially malignant and malignant lesions; however, there is a paucity of evidence using AI for diagnosis of other head and neck pathologies. Overall, the quality of evidence is low, with most studies showing a high risk of bias which is likely to have overestimated accuracy rates. This review highlights the need for development of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in future head and neck research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Introduction: Despite the number of systematic reviews of how artificial intelligence is being used in different areas of medicine, there is no study on the scope of artificial intelligence methods used in outcomes research, the cornerstone of health technology assessment (HTA). This systematic scoping review aims to systematically capture the scope of artificial intelligence methods used in outcomes research to enhance decision-makers’ knowledge and broaden perspectives for health technology assessment and adoption. Areas covered: The review identified 370 studies, consisted of artificial intelligence methods applied to adult patients who underwent any health/medical intervention and reported therapeutic, preventive, or prognostic outcomes. Artificial intelligence was mainly used for the prediction/prognosis of more frequently reported outcomes, efficacy/effectiveness, among morbidity outcomes. The predictive analysis was common in neoplastic disorders. Neural networks algorithm was predominantly found in surgical method studies, but a mixture of artificial intelligence algorithms was applied to the studies with the rest of the interventions. Expert opinion: There are certain gaps in artificial intelligence applications used in outcomes research across therapeutic areas and further considerations are needed by decision-makers before incorporating artificial intelligence usage into HTA decision-making processes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={This study identified the trends in end-of-life care and nursing through text network analysis. About 18,935 articles published until September 2019 were selected through searches on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. For topic modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (K = 8) was applied. Most of the top ranked topic words for the degree and betweenness centralities were consistent with the top 1% through the semantic network diagram. Among the important keywords examined every five years, “care” was unrivaled. When analyzing the two-and three-word combinations, there were many themes representing places, roles, and actions. As a result of performing topic modeling, eight topics were derived as ethical issues of decision-making for treatment withdrawal, symptom management to improve the quality of life, development of end-of-life knowledge education programs, life-sustaining care plan for elderly patients, home-based hospice, communication experience, patient symptom investigation, and an analysis of considering patient preferences. This study is meaningful as it analyzed a large amount of existing literature and considered the main trends of end-of-life care and nursing research based on the core subject control and semantic structure. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Purpose of review To systematically review the current literature to assess the role of radiomics in the detection and evaluation of prostate cancer (PCa). Recent findings Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. Summary Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation. These features can be extracted from existing data; therefore, the potential for future study is immense. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background/purpose: In the recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized in the field of dentistry. The aim of this systematic review was to document the scope and performance of the artificial intelligence based models that have been widely used in orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and predicting the prognosis. Materials and methods: The literature for this paper was identified and selected by performing a thorough search for articles in the electronic data bases like Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Google scholar, Scopus and Web of science, Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000–February 2020). After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. QUADAS-2 were adapted for quality analysis of the studies included. Results: AI technology has been widely applied for identifying cephalometric landmarks, determining need for orthodontic extractions, determining the degree of maturation of the cervical vertebra, predicting the facial attractiveness after orthognathic surgery, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment planning. Most of these artificial intelligence models are based on either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Conclusion: The results from these reported studies are suggesting that these automated systems have performed exceptionally well, with an accuracy and precision similar to the trained examiners. These systems can simplify the tasks and provide results in quick time which can save the dentist time and help the dentist to perform his duties more efficiently. These systems can be of great value in orthodontics. © 2020 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China},

The novel coronavirus disease is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) is a mild to severe respiratory disease having fever, cough, and shortness of breath as initial symptoms. This virus disseminates through contact with infectious persons, touching contaminated surfaces and infectious air droplets. The virus invades into healthy cells of the body especially the lungs causing the respiratory problems and sometimes causes organ failure by killing healthy cells which eventually leads to death. The origin of coronavirus disease was zoonotic, as the initial cases had been reported from animals in Wuhan. This paper presents the literature review on the identification and diagnosis of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the treatment and remedies of COVID-19 patients are discussed utilising machine learning and prediction models.

  abstract={Decision making in case of medical diagnosis is a complicated process. A large number of overlapping structures and cases, and distractions, tiredness, and limitations with the human visual system can lead to inappropriate diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) methods have been employed to assist clinicians in overcoming these limitations and in making informed and correct decisions in disease diagnosis. Many academic papers involving the use of machine learning for disease diagnosis have been increasingly getting published. Hence, to determine the use of ML to improve the diagnosis in varied medical disciplines, a systematic review is conducted in this study. To carry out the review, six different databases are selected. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are employed to limit the research. Further, the eligible articles are classified depending on publication year, authors, type of articles, research objective, inputs and outputs, problem and research gaps, and findings and results. Then the selected articles are analyzed to show the impact of ML methods in improving the disease diagnosis. The findings of this study show the most used ML methods and the most common diseases that are focused on by researchers. It also shows the increase in use of machine learning for disease diagnosis over the years. These results will help in focusing on those areas which are neglected and also to determine various ways in which ML methods could be employed to achieve desirable results. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

  abstract={Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA), which has become increasingly popular, can help provide an accurate understanding of learning processes. However, it is still unclear how multimodal data is integrated into MMLA. By following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this paper systematically surveys 346 articles on MMLA published during the past three years. For this purpose, we first present a conceptual model for reviewing these articles from three dimensions: data types, learning indicators, and data fusion. Based on this model, we then answer the following questions: 1. What types of data and learning indicators are used in MMLA, together with their relationships; and 2. What are the classifications of the data fusion methods in MMLA. Finally, we point out the key stages in data fusion and the future research direction in MMLA. Our main findings from this review are (a) The data in MMLA are classified into digital data, physical data, physiological data, psychometric data, and environment data; (b) The learning indicators are behavior, cognition, emotion, collaboration, and engagement; (c) The relationships between multimodal data and learning indicators are one-to-one, one-to-any, and many-to-one. The complex relationships between multimodal data and learning indicators are the key for data fusion; (d) The main data fusion methods in MMLA are many-to-one, many-to-many and multiple validations among multimodal data; and (e) Multimodal data fusion can be characterized by the multimodality of data, multi-dimension of indicators, and diversity of methods. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), according to DSM-5 in the American Psychiatric Association, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes deficits of social communication and social interaction with the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. Children with ASD have difficulties in joint attention and social reciprocity, using non-verbal and verbal behavior for communication. Due to these deficits, children with autism are often socially isolated. Researchers have emphasized the importance of early identification and early intervention to improve the level of functioning in language, communication, and well-being of children with autism. However, due to limited local assessment tools to diagnose these children, limited speech-language therapy services in rural areas, etc., these children do not get the rehabilitation they need until they get into compulsory schooling at the age of seven years old. Hence, efficient approaches towards early identification and intervention through speedy diagnostic procedures for ASD are required. In recent years, advanced technologies like machine learning have been used to analyze and investigate ASD to improve diagnostic accuracy, time, and quality without complexity. These machine learning methods include artificial neural networks, support vector machines, a priori algorithms, and decision trees, most of which have been applied to datasets connected with autism to construct predictive models. Meanwhile, the selection of features remains an essential task before developing a predictive model for ASD classification. This review mainly investigates and analyzes up-to-date studies on machine learning methods for feature selection and classification of ASD. We recommend methods to enhance machine learning’s speedy execution for processing complex data for conceptualization and implementation in ASD diagnostic research. This study can significantly benefit future research in autism using a machine learning approach for feature selection, classification, and processing imbalanced data. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={In professional soccer, increasing amounts of data are collected that harness great potential when it comes to analysing tactical behaviour. Unlocking this potential is difficult as big data challenges the data management and analytics methods commonly employed in sports. By joining forces with computer science, solutions to these challenges could be achieved, helping sports science to find new insights, as is happening in other scientific domains. We aim to bring multiple domains together in the context of analysing tactical behaviour in soccer using position tracking data. A systematic literature search for studies employing position tracking data to study tactical behaviour in soccer was conducted in seven electronic databases, resulting in 2338 identified studies and finally the inclusion of 73 papers. Each domain clearly contributes to the analysis of tactical behaviour, albeit in–sometimes radically–different ways. Accordingly, we present a multidisciplinary framework where each domain’s contributions to feature construction, modelling and interpretation can be situated. We discuss a set of key challenges concerning the data analytics process, specifically feature construction, spatial and temporal aggregation. Moreover, we discuss how these challenges could be resolved through multidisciplinary collaboration, which is pivotal in unlocking the potential of position tracking data in sports analytics. © 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract={With the emergence of the Internet, Recommendation Systems (RS) have emerged due to their ability to manage a massive amount of information. RS plays a very important role in guiding users' decisions and making their tasks easier. Additionally, food and its impact on wellbeing, metabolism, and success at school, during sports, or at work are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the most related food RSs according to healthcare. Furthermore, we propose SIHATI, a new knowledge-based food RS integrating machine learning techniques, that can be used to assist persons in finding relevant food. In particular, we implement SIHATI, which we present its general idea in this paper. Preliminary results indicate that integrating machine learning ML) techniques into the RSs will provide efficient and accurate recommendations. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

  abstract={The purpose of this systematic review was twofold: (a) identify prediction models for musculoskeletal injuries during the participation of professional sporting activities and (b) evaluate these models by their predictive performances. A systematic review of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed using specific search terms selected according to the PRISMA guidelines. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. The most commonly employed data component for data pre-processing was body composition data (most commonly, body mass and height), followed by player profile (most commonly, age followed by position). The most common machine learning technique for data processing was the decision tree, followed by logistic regression. The median AUC of the best performing models indicated per study was 0.75 (0.16), median sensitivity/recall was 0.78 (0.15), median specificity was 0.81 (0.27), and median precision was 0.53 (0.13). The performance of prediction models in the literature has been poor, caused by a fundamental difficulty in discovering real effects in small sample sizes with low injury rates. A better understanding of how training and game exposure is associated with the data components for data pre-processing and ultimately associated with injury is vital for the future development of robust injury prediction models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In a systematic search of more than 1,500 documents, we found 41 articles studying BD in Human Resource Management (HRM). Results show that BD means a new approach and methodology to manage data on employees and numerous opportunities for HRM, but also important challenges at a technological, methodological and ethical level. Five main clusters of HR practice systems have been identified, concentrating the largest number of papers in the cluster of ​​information, learning and knowledge and in the cluster of ​​strategy, efficiency and performance, suggesting a trend in the studies that is explained by the nature and characteristics of the BD.

  abstract={Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting approximately 1 out of 70 (range 1:59 - 1:89) children worldwide. It is characterized by a delay in cognitive capabilities, repetitive and restricted behaviors and deficit in communication and social interaction. Several factors seem to be associated with ASD development; its heterogeneous nature makes the diagnosis difficult and slow since it is essentially based on screening tools focused on stereotypical and repetitive behaviors, gait, facial emotion expression and speech assessments. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used to investigate ASD with the overall goal of simplifying and speeding up the diagnostic process as well as making earlier access to therapies possible. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research in the ASD field, identifying and describing machine learning (ML) approaches in ASD literature that could be used by clinicians to improve diagnostic capability and treatment efficiency. A systematic search was conducted and the resulting articles were subdivided into several categories reflecting the different fields of study associated with ASD research. The existing literature has widely demonstrated the potential of ML in several types of ASD study analyses: behavior, gait, speech, facial emotion expression, neuroimaging, genetics, and metabolomics. Therefore, AI techniques are becoming increasingly implemented and accepted, so highlighting the power of ML approaches to extract and obtain knowledge from a large volume of data. This makes ML a promising tool for future ASD research and clinical endeavors suggesting possible avenues for improving ASD screening, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={Background: Connected interventions use data collected through mobile/wearable devices to trigger real-time interventions and have great potential to improve treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). This review aims to describe the current landscape, effectiveness and usability of connected interventions for SUD. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify articles evaluating connected health interventions for SUD in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, IEEE, and Scopus) were searched over a five-year period. Included articles described a connected health intervention targeting SUD and provided outcomes data. Data were extracted using a standardized reporting tool. Results: A total of 1676 unique articles were identified during the initial search, with 32 articles included in the final analysis. Seven articles of the 32 were derived from two large studies. The most commonly studied SUD was alcohol use disorder. Sixteen articles reported at least one statistically significant result with respect to reduced craving and/or substance use. The majority of articles used ecological momentary assessment to trigger interventions, while four used biologic/physiologic data. Two articles used a wearable device. Common intervention types included craving management, coping assistance, and tailored feedback. Twenty-three articles measured usability factors, and acceptability was generally reported as high. Conclusion: Identified themes included a focus on AUD, use of smart phones, use of EMA for intervention delivery, positive effects on SUD related outcomes, and overall high acceptability. Wearables that directly monitor biologic data and predictive analytics using integrated data streams represent understudied opportunities for new research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={For the last one decade, research in self-regulated learning (SRL) and educational psychology has proliferated. Researchers and educators have focused on how to support leaners grow their SRL skills on both face-to-face and e-learning environments. In addition, recent studies and meta-analysis have greatly contributed to the domain knowledge on the use of SRL strategies and how they contribute and boost academic performance for learners. However, there is little systematic review on the literature on the techniques and tools used to measure SRL on e-learning platforms. This review sought to outline recent advances and the trends in this area to make it more efficient for researchers to establish the empirical studies and research patterns among different studies in the field of SRL. The findings from this study are concurrent with existing empirical evidence that traditional methods designed for classroom supports are being used for measuring SRL on e-learning environments. Few studies have used learner analytics and educational data mining (EDM) techniques to measure and promote SRL strategies for learners. The paper finally points out the existing gaps with the tools presently used to measure and support SRL on learning management systems and recommends further studies on the areas of EDM which can support SRL. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose: Educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics, which are highly related subjects but have different definitions and focuses, have enabled instructors to obtain a holistic view of student progress and trigger corresponding decision-making. Furthermore, the automation part of EDM is closer to the concept of artificial intelligence. Due to the wide applications of artificial intelligence in assorted fields, the authors are curious about the state-of-art of related applications in Education. Design/methodology/approach: This study focused on systematically reviewing 1,219 EDM studies that were searched from five digital databases based on a strict search procedure. Although 33 reviews were attempted to synthesize research literature, several research gaps were identified. A comprehensive and systematic review report is needed to show us: what research trends can be revealed and what major research topics and open issues are existed in EDM research. Findings: Results show that the EDM research has moved toward the early majority stage; EDM publications are mainly contributed by “actual analysis” category; machine learning or even deep learning algorithms have been widely adopted, but collecting actual larger data sets for EDM research is rare, especially in K-12. Four major research topics, including prediction of performance, decision support for teachers and learners, detection of behaviors and learner modeling and comparison or optimization of algorithms, have been identified. Some open issues and future research directions in EDM field are also put forward. Research limitations/implications: Limitations for this search method include the likelihood of missing EDM research that was not captured through these portals. Originality/value: This systematic review has not only reported the research trends of EDM but also discussed open issues to direct future research. Finally, it is concluded that the state-of-art of EDM research is far from the ideal of artificial intelligence and the automatic support part for teaching and learning in EDM may need improvement in the future work. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In particular, we identified the six main objectives (ie, behavioral trajectories, learning outcome, learning-task performance, teacher support, engagement and student feedback) that the MMLA research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed articles and frame them within six thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a framework that would enable MMD capacities to be aligned with the research and learning design (LD). These MMD capacities could also be utilized on furthering theory and practice. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and democratization of MMD within future learning technology research and development. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Capturing and measuring learners’ engagement and behavior using MMD has been explored in recent years and exhibits great potential. There are documented challenges and opportunities associated with capturing, processing, analyzing and interpreting MMD to support human learning. MMD can provide insights into predicting learning engagement and performance as well as into supporting the process. What this paper adds Provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical evidence on MMD for human learning. Summarizes the insights MMD can give us about the learning outcomes and process. Identifies challenges and opportunities of MMD to support human learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the SLR as a guide for future research. Learning analytics practitioners will be able to use the SLR as a summary of the current state of the field. © 2020 The Authors.

  abstract={Robotics technology has become increasingly common both for businesses and for private citizens. Primary and secondary schools, as a mirror of societal evolution, have increasingly integrated science, technology, engineering and math concepts into their curricula. Our research questions are: “In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which pedagogical-methodological interventions result in better understanding and knowledge in the use of sensors in educational robotics?”, and “In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which analytical methods related to Learning Analytics processes are proposed to analyze and reflect on students’ behavior in their learning of concepts and skills of sensors in educational robotics?”. To answer these questions, we have carried out a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus databases regarding robotics sensors in primary and secondary education, and Learning Analytics processes. We applied PRISMA methodology and reviewed a total of 24 articles. The results show a consensus about the use of the Learning by Doing and Project-Based Learning methodologies, including their different variations, as the most common methodology for achieving optimal engagement, motivation and performance in students’ learning. Finally, future lines of research are identified from this study. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Background: Predictions in pregnancy care are complex because of interactions among multiple factors. Hence, pregnancy outcomes are not easily predicted by a single predictor using only one algorithm or modeling method. Objective: This study aims to review and compare the predictive performances between logistic regression (LR) and other machine learning algorithms for developing or validating a multivariable prognostic prediction model for pregnancy care to inform clinicians’ decision making. Methods: Research articles from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were reviewed following several guidelines for a prognostic prediction study, including a risk of bias (ROB) assessment. We report the results based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies were primarily framed as PICOTS (population, index, comparator, outcomes, timing, and setting): Population: men or women in procreative management, pregnant women, and fetuses or newborns; Index: multivariable prognostic prediction models using non-LR algorithms for risk classification to inform clinicians’ decision making; Comparator: the models applying an LR; Outcomes: pregnancy-related outcomes of procreation or pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women and fetuses or newborns; Timing: pre-, inter-, and peripregnancy periods (predictors), at the pregnancy, delivery, and either puerperal or neonatal period (outcome), and either short- or long-term prognoses (time interval); and Setting: primary care or hospital. The results were synthesized by reporting study characteristics and ROBs and by random effects modeling of the difference of the logit area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of each non-LR model compared with the LR model for the same pregnancy outcomes. We also reported between-study heterogeneity by using τ2 and I2. Results: Of the 2093 records, we included 142 studies for the systematic review and 62 studies for a meta-analysis. Most prediction models used LR (92/142, 64.8%) and artificial neural networks (20/142, 14.1%) among non-LR algorithms. Only 16.9% (24/142) of studies had a low ROB. A total of 2 non-LR algorithms from low ROB studies significantly outperformed LR. The first algorithm was a random forest for preterm delivery (logit AUROC 2.51, 95% CI 1.49-3.53; I2=86%; τ2=0.77) and pre-eclampsia (logit AUROC 1.2, 95% CI 0.72-1.67; I2=75%; τ2=0.09). The second algorithm was gradient boosting for cesarean section (logit AUROC 2.26, 95% CI 1.39-3.13; I2=75%; τ2=0.43) and gestational diabetes (logit AUROC 1.03, 95% CI 0.69-1.37; I2=83%; τ2=0.07). Conclusions: Prediction models with the best performances across studies were not necessarily those that used LR but also used random forest and gradient boosting that also performed well. We recommend a reanalysis of existing LR models for several pregnancy outcomes by comparing them with those algorithms that apply standard guidelines. ©Herdiantri Sufriyana, Atina Husnayain, Ya-Lin Chen, Chao-Yang Kuo, Onkar Singh, Tso-Yang Yeh, Yu-Wei Wu, Emily Chia-Yu Su.},

  abstract={To examine the similarities and differences between two closely related yet distinct fields–Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA)–this study conducted a literature review of the empirical studies published in both fields. We synthesized 492 LA and 194 EDM articles published during 2015–2019. We compared the similarities and differences in research across the two fields by examining data analysis tools, common keywords, theories, and definitions listed. We found that most studies in both fields did not clearly identify a theoretical framework. For both fields, theories of self-regulated learning are most frequently used. We found, through keyword analysis, that both fields are closely related to each other as “learning analytics” is most frequently listed keyword for EDM and vice versa for LA. However, one notable difference relates to how LA studies listed social-related keywords whereas EDM studies listed keywords related to technical methods. The tools used for data analysis overlap largely but some of the LA studies listed tools for qualitative data analysis and social network analysis whereas EDM studies did not. Finally, the distinction of the two fields is defined differently by authors as some demarcate the differences whereas some address them interchangeably. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract={A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) aims to assist physicians, nurses and other professionals in decision-making related to the patient's clinical condition. CDSSs deal with pertinent and critical data, and special care should be taken in their design to ensure the development of usable, secure and reliable tools. Objective: This paper aims to investigate existing literature dealing with the development process of CDSSs for monitoring chronic diseases, analysing their functionalities and characteristics, and the software engineering representation in their design. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted to analyse the literature on CDSSs for monitoring chronic diseases and the application of software engineering techniques in their design. Results: Fourteen included studies revealed that the most addressed disease was diabetes (42.8%) and the most commonly proposed approach was diagnostic (85.7%). Regarding data sources, the studies show a predominance on the use of databases (85.7%), with other data sources such as sensors (42.8%) and self-report (28.6%) also being considered. Analysing the representation for engineering techniques, we found Behaviour diagrams (42.8%) to be the most frequent, closely followed by Structural diagrams (35.7%) and others (78.6%) being largely mentioned. Some studies also approached the requirement specification (21.4%). The most common target evaluation was the performance of the system (64.2%) and the most common metric was accuracy (57.1%). Conclusion: We conclude that software engineering, in its completeness, has scarce representation in studies focused on the development of CDSSs for chronic diseases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Diabetes is one of the most deadly and chronic diseases which cause an increase in blood sugar. If diabetes remains untreated and unidentified many difficulties may arise due to that. The tedious work is in identifying the process which results in visiting the clinic and consulting the doctor. But this tedious work has been solved with the rise in the approaches used by machine learning. Over recent years a plenty of growth has been seen doing over health informatics by focusing on the technology of the presentation, generation and application of clinical information in health care. With the motive of improving outcomes of health for patients and creating efficiency in health professions a Healthcare Informatics or eHealth solutions, has empowered the accessibility of clinical data through computer networks or cloud computing. Its accessibility and understanding have become easier with language technologies. This paper gives a comprehensive prospect of work accomplished to develop a model that can predict the possibility of diabetes in patients with extreme accuracy. Therefore, various machine learning classification algorithms are used for detecting diabetes. In this paper, the author has studied various machine learning classification algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, decision tree, random forest, Logistic regression, SVM and Naive Bayes. Experiments are carried out on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) which is track down from the UCI machine learning repository. Further author has done the comparison among various performances of all the different algorithms. The performances are categories of various measures like Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure and Recall. The paper helps in identifying the algorithm to classify the risk of diabetes. Different techniques were applied to the algorithms for improving the robustness. Additionally, the findings suggest that the best performance of disease risk classification is done with the help of a genetic algorithm. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This systematic review summarizes all the data currently available on the AI-assisted CT-Scan prediction accuracy for COVID-19. The ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Science Direct, PROSPERO, and EMBASE were systematically searched. We used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool to assess all included studies' quality and potential bias. A hierarchical receiver-operating characteristic summary (HSROC) curve and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve have been implemented. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the diagnostic accuracy. Finally, 36 studies (a total of 39,246 image data) were selected for inclusion into the final meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity for AI was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.90–0.91), specificity was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90–0.92) and the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91–0.98). For deep learning (DL) method, the pooled sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.90–0.91), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87–0.88) and the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97). In case of machine learning (ML), the pooled sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.90–0.91), specificity was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.95) and the AUC was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99).

  abstract={Background: Chatbots have been used in the last decade to improve access to mental health care services. Perceptions and opinions of patients influence the adoption of chatbots for health care. Many studies have been conducted to assess the perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review of the evidence surrounding perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. Objective: This study aims to conduct a scoping review of the perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Methods: The scoping review was carried out in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Studies were identified by searching 8 electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE and Embase) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. In total, 2 reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results: Of 1072 citations retrieved, 37 unique studies were included in the review. The thematic analysis generated 10 themes from the findings of the studies: Usefulness, ease of use, responsiveness, understandability, acceptability, attractiveness, trustworthiness, enjoyability, content, and comparisons. Conclusions: The results demonstrated overall positive perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Important issues to be addressed in the future are the linguistic capabilities of the chatbots: They have to be able to deal adequately with unexpected user input, provide high-quality responses, and have to show high variability in responses. To be useful for clinical practice, we have to find ways to harmonize chatbot content with individual treatment recommendations, that is, a personalization of chatbot conversations is required. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Background. Radiation-induced toxicity represents a crucial concern in oncological treatments of patients affected by head and neck neoplasms, due to its impact on survivors' quality of life. Published reports suggested the potential of radiomics combined with machine learning methods in the prediction and assessment of radiation-induced toxicities, supporting a tailored radiation treatment management. In this paper, we present an update of the current knowledge concerning these modern approaches. Materials and Methods. A systematic review according to PICO-PRISMA methodology was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases until June 2019. Studies assessing the use of radiomics combined with machine learning in predicting radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients were specifically included. Four authors (two independently and two in concordance) assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Radiomic Quality Score (RQS). The overall score for each analyzed study was obtained by the sum of the single RQS items; the average and standard deviation values of the authors' RQS were calculated and reported. Results. Eight included papers, presenting data on parotid glands, cochlea, masticatory muscles, and white brain matter, were specifically analyzed in this review. Only one study had an average RQS was ≤ 30% (50%), while 3 studies obtained a RQS almost ≤ 25%. Potential variability in the interpretations of specific RQS items could have influenced the inter-rater agreement in specific cases. Conclusions. Published radiomic studies provide encouraging but still limited and preliminary data that require further validation to improve the decision-making processes in preventing and managing radiation-induced toxicities.  © 2021 Roberta Carbonara et al.},

  abstract={Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a well-established medical system with a long history. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding in many fields including TCM. AI will significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of diagnostics, thus increasing the use of effective therapeutic methods for patients. This systematic review provides an updated overview on the major breakthroughs in the field of AI-assisted TCM four diagnostic methods, syndrome differentiation, and treatment. AI-assisted TCM diagnosis is mainly based on digital data collected by modern electronic instruments, which makes TCM diagnosis more quantitative, objective, and standardized. As a result, the diagnosis decisions made by different TCM doctors exhibit more consistency, accuracy, and reliability. Meanwhile, the therapeutic efficacy of TCM can be evaluated objectively. Therefore, AI is promoting TCM from experience to evidence-based medicine, a genuine scientific revolution. Furthermore, huge and non-uniform knowledge on formula-syndrome relationships and the combination rules of herbal TCM formulae could be better standardized with the help of AI analysis, which is necessary for the clinical efficacy evaluation and further optimization on the standardized TCM formulae. AI bridges the gap between TCM and modern science and technology. AI may bring clinical TCM diagnostics closer to western medicine. With the help of AI, more scientific evidence about TCM will be discovered. It can be expected that more unified guidelines for specific TCM syndromes will be issued with the development of AI-assisted TCM therapies in the future. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract={Study Design: This was a systematic review of existing literature. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the current state-of-the-art trends and utilization of machine learning in the field of spine surgery. Summary of Background Data: The past decade has seen a rise in the clinical use of machine learning in many fields including diagnostic radiology and oncology. While studies have been performed that specifically pertain to spinal surgery, there have been relatively few aggregate reviews of the existing scientific literature as applied to clinical spine surgery. Methods: This study utilized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to review the scientific literature from 2009 to 2019 with syntax specific for machine learning and spine surgery applications. Specific data was extracted from the available literature including algorithm application, algorithms tested, database type and size, algorithm training method, and outcome of interest. Results: A total of 44 studies met inclusion criteria, of which the majority were level III evidence. Studies were grouped into 4 general types: diagnostic tools, clinical outcome prediction, surgical assessment tools, and decision support tools. Across studies, a wide swath of algorithms were used, which were trained across multiple disparate databases. There were no studies identified that assessed the ethical implementation or patient perceptions of machine learning in clinical care. Conclusions: The results reveal the broad range of clinical applications and methods used to create machine learning algorithms for use in the field of spine surgery. Notable disparities exist in algorithm choice, database characteristics, and training methods. Ongoing research is needed to make machine learning operational on a large scale.

  abstract={Introduction: Electrode misplacement and interchange errors are known problems when recording the 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Automatic detection of these errors could play an important role for improving clinical decision making and outcomes in cardiac care. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to 1) study the impact of electrode misplacement on ECG signals and ECG interpretation, 2) to determine the most challenging electrode misplacements to detect using machine learning (ML), 3) to analyse the ML performance of algorithms that detect electrode misplacement or interchange according to sensitivity and specificity and 4) to identify the most commonly used ML technique for detecting electrode misplacement/interchange. This review analysed the current literature regarding electrode misplacement/interchange recognition accuracy using machine learning techniques. Method: A search of three online databases including IEEE, PubMed and ScienceDirect identified 228 articles, while 3 articles were included from additional sources from co-authors. According to the eligibility criteria, 14 articles were selected. The selected articles were considered for qualitative analysis and meta-analysis. Results: The articles showed the effect of lead interchange on ECG morphology and as a consequence on patient diagnoses. Statistical analysis of the included articles found that machine learning performance is high in detecting electrode misplacement/interchange except left arm/left leg interchange. Conclusion: This review emphasises the importance of detecting electrode misplacement detection in ECG diagnosis and the effects on decision making. Machine learning shows promise in detecting lead misplacement/interchange and highlights an opportunity for developing and operationalising deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect electrode misplacement/interchange. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={The diagnosis and management of prostate cancer involves the interpretation of data from multiple modalities to aid in decision making. Tools like PSA levels, MRI guided biopsies, genomic biomarkers, and Gleason grading are used to diagnose, risk stratify, and then monitor patients during respective follow-ups. Nevertheless, diagnosis tracking and subsequent risk stratification often lend itself to significant subjectivity. Artificial intelligence (AI) can allow clinicians to recognize difficult relationships and manage enormous data sets, which is a task that is both extraordinarily difficult and time consuming for humans. By using AI algorithms and reducing the level of subjectivity, it is possible to use fewer resources while improving the overall efficiency and accuracy in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

  abstract={There is growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to support decision-making in health and social care settings. There is, however, currently limited evidence of the effectiveness of these systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based computerised decision support systems in health and social care settings. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify relevant randomised controlled trials conducted between 2013 and 2018. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ASSIA, Emerald, Health Business Fulltext Elite, ProQuest Public Health, Social Care Online, and grey literature sources. Search terms were conceptualised into three groups: artificial intelligence-related terms, computerised decision support -related terms, and terms relating to health and social care. Terms within groups were combined using the Boolean operator OR, and groups were combined using the Boolean operator AND. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the eligibility criteria and two independent reviewers extracted data on eligible studies onto a customised sheet. We assessed the quality of studies through the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for randomised controlled trials. We then conducted a narrative synthesis. We identified 68 hits of which five studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies varied substantially in relation to quality, settings, outcomes, and technologies. None of the studies was conducted in social care settings, and three randomised controlled trials showed no difference in patient outcomes. Of these, one investigated the use of Bayesian triage algorithms on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and health-related quality of life in lung transplant patients. Another investigated the effect of image pattern recognition on neonatal development outcomes in pregnant women, and another investigated the effect of the Kalman filter technique for warfarin dosing suggestions on time in therapeutic range. The remaining two randomised controlled trials, investigating computer vision and neural networks on medication adherence and the impact of learning algorithms on assessment time of patients with gestational diabetes, showed statistically significant and clinically important differences to the control groups receiving standard care. However, these studies tended to be of low quality lacking detailed descriptions of methods and only one study used a double-blind design. Although the evidence of effectiveness of data-driven artificial intelligence to support decision-making in health and social care settings is limited, this work provides important insights on how a meaningful evidence base in this emerging field needs to be developed going forward. It is unlikely that any single overall message surrounding effectiveness will emerge - rather effectiveness of interventions is likely to be context-specific and calls for inclusion of a range of study designs to investigate mechanisms of action. © The Author(s) 2020.},

  abstract={Mobile and Ubiquitous Learning (m/u-learning) are finding an increasing adoption in education. They are often distinguished by hybrid learning environments that encompass elements of formal and informal learning, in activities that happen in distributed settings (indoors and outdoors), across physical and virtual spaces. Despite their purported benefits, these environments imply additional complexity in the design, monitoring and evaluation of learning activities. The research literature on learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) has started to deal with these issues. This paper presents a systematic literature review of LD and LA, in m/u-learning. Apart from providing an overview of the current research in the field, this review elicits elements of common ground between both communities, as shown by the similar learning contexts and complementary research contributions, and based on the research gaps, proposes to: address m/u-learning beyond higher education settings, reinforce the connection between physical and virtual learning spaces, and more systematically align LD and LA processes. © 2020 British Educational Research Association},

  abstract={Medical bioengineering professionals are expected to play a leading role in the development of advanced algorithms and methods with the greater goal to enhance health care in fields like diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. In a recent study on the current research areas in big data analytics and artificial intelligence in health care, after a systematic review of literature, it was found that the primary interest area is medical image processing and analysis followed by decision-support systems and text mining. Case-based learning is an instructional design model that is learner-centered and intensively used across a variety of disciplines. In this paper, it is presented a set of deep learning tools and a case study that help medical bioengineering students to grasp both theoretical concepts (medical, such as gynecological disorders and technological, such as deep learning, neural network architectures, learning algorithms) and delve into practical applications of these techniques in medical image processing. The case study concerns the automated diagnosis of cervigrams (also called cervicographic images), that are colposcopy images used by the gynecologist for cervical cancer diagnosis. The tools described in this paper are based on using PyTorch and are implemented in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook introduces the students to the problem of cervigrams classification, provides access to the dataset, allows data augmentation, data visualization and performing transfer learning. The notebook ends with study questions. © 2020, National Defence University-Carol I Printing House. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Predictive analytics using electronic health record (EHR) data have rapidly advanced over the last decade. While model performance metrics have improved considerably, best practices for implementing predictive models into clinical settings for point-of-care risk stratification are still evolving. Here, we conducted a systematic review of articles describing predictive models integrated into EHR systems and implemented in clinical practice. We conducted an exhaustive database search and extracted data encompassing multiple facets of implementation. We assessed study quality and level of evidence. We obtained an initial 3393 articles for screening, from which a final set of 44 articles was included for data extraction and analysis. The most common clinical domains of implemented predictive models were related to thrombotic disorders/anticoagulation (25%) and sepsis (16%). The majority of studies were conducted in inpatient academic settings. Implementation challenges included alert fatigue, lack of training, and increased work burden on the care team. Of 32 studies that reported effects on clinical outcomes, 22 (69%) demonstrated improvement after model implementation. Overall, EHR-based predictive models offer promising results for improving clinical outcomes, although several gaps in the literature remain, and most study designs were observational.

  abstract={Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. Deep learning methods have achieved promising results on predictive healthcare tasks using ECG signals. Objective: This paper presents a systematic review of deep learning methods for ECG data from both modeling and application perspectives. Methods: We extracted papers that applied deep learning (deep neural network) models to ECG data that were published between January 1st of 2010 and February 29th of 2020 from Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Digital Bibliography & Library Project. We then analyzed each article according to three factors: tasks, models, and data. Finally, we discuss open challenges and unsolved problems in this area. Results: The total number of papers extracted was 191. Among these papers, 108 were published after 2019. Different deep learning architectures have been used in various ECG analytics tasks, such as disease detection/classification, annotation/localization, sleep staging, biometric human identification, and denoising. Conclusion: The number of works on deep learning for ECG data has grown explosively in recent years. Such works have achieved accuracy comparable to that of traditional feature-based approaches and ensembles of multiple approaches can achieve even better results. Specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features yields the best results. However, there are some new challenges and problems related to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency that must be addressed. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from the perspectives of datasets and methods. Significance: This paper summarizes existing deep learning research using ECG data from multiple perspectives and highlights existing challenges and problems to identify potential future research directions. © 2020},

  abstract={The demand for liver transplantation far outstrips the supply of deceased donor organs, and so, listing and allocation decisions aim to maximize utility. Most existing methods for predicting transplant outcomes use basic methods, such as regression modeling, but newer artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to improve predictive accuracy. The aim was to perform a systematic review of studies predicting graft outcomes following deceased donor liver transplantation using AI techniques and to compare these findings to linear regression and standard predictive modeling: donor risk index (DRI), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), and Survival Outcome Following Liver Transplantation (SOFT). After reviewing available article databases, a total of 52 articles were reviewed for inclusion. Of these articles, 9 met the inclusion criteria, which reported outcomes from 18,771 liver transplants. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were the most commonly used methodology, being reported in 7 studies. Only 2 studies directly compared machine learning (ML) techniques to liver scoring modalities (i.e., DRI, SOFT, and balance of risk [BAR]). Both studies showed better prediction of individual organ survival with the optimal ANN model, reporting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.82 compared with BAR (0.62) and SOFT (0.57), and the other ANN model gave an AUC ROC of 0.84 compared with a DRI (0.68) and SOFT (0.64). AI techniques can provide high accuracy in predicting graft survival based on donors and recipient variables. When compared with the standard techniques, AI methods are dynamic and are able to be trained and validated within every population. However, the high accuracy of AI may come at a cost of losing explainability (to patients and clinicians) on how the technology works.

  abstract={Background: Digital health interventions based on tools for Computerized Decision Support (CDS) and Machine Learning (ML), which take advantage of new information, sensing and communication technologies, can play a key role in childhood obesity prevention and treatment. Objectives: We present a systematic literature review of CDS and ML applications for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. The main characteristics and outcomes of studies using CDS and ML are demonstrated, to advance our understanding towards the development of smart and effective interventions for childhood obesity care. Methods: A search in the bibliographic databases of PubMed and Scopus was performed to identify childhood obesity studies incorporating either CDS interventions, or advanced data analytics through ML algorithms. Ongoing, case, and qualitative studies, along with those not providing specific quantitative outcomes were excluded. The studies incorporating CDS were synthesized according to the intervention's main technology (e.g., mobile app), design type (e.g., randomized controlled trial), number of enrolled participants, target age of children, participants’ follow-up duration, primary outcome (e.g., Body Mass Index (BMI)), and main CDS feature(s) and their outcomes (e.g., alerts for caregivers when BMI is high). The studies incorporating ML were synthesized according to the number of subjects included and their age, the ML algorithm(s) used (e.g., logistic regression), as well as their main outcome (e.g., prediction of obesity). Results: The literature search identified 8 studies incorporating CDS interventions and 9 studies utilizing ML algorithms, which met our eligibility criteria. All studies reported statistically significant interventional or ML model outcomes (e.g., in terms of accuracy). More than half of the interventional studies (n = 5, 63 %) were designed as randomized controlled trials. Half of the interventional studies (n = 4, 50 %) utilized Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and alerts for BMI as means of CDS. From the 9 studies using ML, the highest percentage targeted at the prognosis of obesity (n = 4, 44 %). In the studies incorporating more than one ML algorithms and reporting accuracy, it was shown that decision trees and artificial neural networks can accurately predict childhood obesity. Conclusions: This review has found that CDS tools can be useful for the self-management or remote medical management of childhood obesity, whereas ML algorithms such as decision trees and artificial neural networks can be helpful for prediction purposes. Further rigorous studies in the area of CDS and ML for childhood obesity care are needed, considering the low number of studies identified in this review, their methodological limitations, and the scarcity of interventional studies incorporating ML algorithms in CDS tools. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Motivation: Emergency Departments’ (ED) modern triage systems implemented worldwide are solely based upon medical knowledge and experience. This is a limitation of these systems, since there might be hidden patterns that can be explored in big volumes of clinical historical data. Intelligent techniques can be applied to these data to develop clinical decision support systems (CDSS) thereby providing the health professionals with objective criteria. Therefore, it is of foremost importance to identify what has been hampering the application of such systems for ED triage. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to assess how intelligent CDSS for triage have been contributing to the improvement of quality of care in the ED as well as to identify the challenges they have been facing regarding implementation. Methods: We applied a standard scoping review method with the manual search of 6 digital libraries, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Springer, MedlinePlus and Web of Knowledge. Search queries were created and customized for each digital library in order to acquire the information. The core search consisted of searching in the papers’ title, abstract and key words for the topics “triage”, “emergency department”/“emergency room” and concepts within the field of intelligent systems. Results: From the review search, we found that logistic regression was the most frequently used technique for model design and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) the most frequently used performance measure. Beside triage priority, the most frequently used variables for modelling were patients’ age, gender, vital signs and chief complaints. The main contributions of the selected papers consisted in the improvement of a patient's prioritization, prediction of need for critical care, hospital or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, ED Length of Stay (LOS) and mortality from information available at the triage. Conclusions: In the papers where CDSS were validated in the ED, the authors found that there was an improvement in the health professionals’ decision-making thereby leading to better clinical management and patients’ outcomes. However, we found that more than half of the studies lacked this implementation phase. We concluded that for these studies, it is necessary to validate the CDSS and to define key performance measures in order to demonstrate the extent to which incorporation of CDSS at triage can actually improve care. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The ever-increasing amount of biomedical data is enabling new large-scale studies, even though ad hoc computational solutions are required. The most recent Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been achieving outstanding performance and an important impact in clinical research, aiming at precision medicine, as well as improving healthcare workflows. However, the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty in the healthcare information sources pose new compelling challenges for clinicians in their decision-making tasks. Only the proper combination of AI and human intelligence capabilities, by explicitly taking into account effective and safe interaction paradigms, can permit the delivery of care that outperforms what either can do separately. Therefore, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in the design of software oriented to decision-making in medicine. In this work, we systematically review and discuss several research fields strictly linked to HCI and clinical decision-making, by subdividing the articles into six themes, namely: Interfaces, Visualization, Electronic Health Records, Devices, Usability, and Clinical Decision Support Systems. However, these articles typically present overlaps among the themes, revealing that HCI inter-connects multiple topics. With the goal of focusing on HCI and design aspects, the articles under consideration were grouped into four clusters. The advances in AI can effectively support the physicians’ cognitive processes, which certainly play a central role in decision-making tasks because the human mental behavior cannot be completely emulated and captured; the human mind might solve a complex problem even without a statistically significant amount of data by relying upon domain knowledge. For this reason, technology must focus on interactive solutions for supporting the physicians effectively in their daily activities, by exploiting their unique knowledge and evidence-based reasoning, as well as improving the various aspects highlighted in this review. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice. Objective: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments. Results: This systematic review revealed that recent publications recommend the integration of AI training into medical and health informatics curricula. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring the current state of AI education in both medicine and health informatics. Since AI curricula have not been standardized and competencies have not been determined, a framework for specialized AI training in medical and health informatics education is proposed. © A Hasan Sapci, H Aylin Sapci.},

  abstract={Background: It could be seen in the previous decades that Machine Learning (ML) has a huge variety of possible implementations in medicine and can be of great use. Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases cause about a third of the total global deaths. Does ML work in the cardiology domain and what is the current progress in this regard? To answer this question, we present a systematic review aiming at 1) identifying studies where machine learning algorithms were applied in the domain of cardiology; 2) providing an overview based on the existing literature about the state-of-the-art ML algorithms applied in cardiology. Methods: For organizing this review, we adopted the PRISMA statement. We used PubMed as the search engine and identified the search keywords as “Machine Learning”, “Data Mining”, “Cardiology”, and “Cardiovascular” in combinations. Scientific articles and conference papers published between 2013-2017 reporting about implementations of ML algorithms in the domain of cardiology have been included in this review. Results: In total, 27 relevant papers were included. We examined four aspects: the aims of ML systems, the methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The major part of the paper was aimed at predicting the risk of mortality. A promising branch of Machine Learning, the ‘Reinforcement Learning’, was also never proposed in the observed papers. Tree-based ensembles are common and show good results, whereas deep neural networks are poorly represented. Most papers (20 of 27) have used datasets that are hardly available for other researchers, e.g. unpublished local registries. We also identified 28 different metrics for model evaluation. This variety of metrics makes it difficult to compare the results of different researches. Conclusion: We suppose that this systematic review will be helpful for researchers developing medical machine learning systems and for cardiology in particular. © 2020 Dudchenko et al.},

  abstract={Background: To deal with complexity in cancer care, computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are developed to support quality of care and improve decision-making. We performed a systematic review to explore the value of CDSSs using automated clinical guidelines, Artificial Intelligence, datamining or statistical methods (higher level CDSSs) on the quality of care in oncology. Materials and Methods: The search strategy combined synonyms for ‘CDSS’ and ‘cancer.’ Pubmed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Association of Computing Machinery digital library and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2000 to December 2019. Included studies evaluated the impact of higher level CDSSs on process outcomes, guideline adherence and clinical outcomes. Results: 11,397 studies were selected for screening, after which 61 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, nine studies were included in the final analysis with a total population size of 7985 patients. Types of cancer included breast cancer (63.1%), lung cancer (27.8%), prostate cancer (4.1%), colorectal cancer (3.1%) and other cancer types (1.9%). The included studies demonstrated significant improvements of higher level CDSSs on process outcomes and guideline adherence across diverse settings in oncology. No significant differences were reported for clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Higher level CDSSs seem to improve process outcomes and guidelines adherence but not clinical outcomes. It should be noticed that the included studies primarily focused on breast and lung cancer. To further explore the impact of higher level CDSSs on quality of care, high-quality research is required. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Background. The purpose of this review is to depict current research and impact of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms on dialysis and kidney transplantation. Published studies were presented from two points of view: What medical aspects were covered? What AI/ML algorithms have been used? Methods. We searched four electronic databases or studies that used AI/ML in hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT). Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. Results. AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Conclusions. Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis. Altogether, these trials report a robust impact of AI/ML on quality of life and survival in G5D/T patients. In the coming years, one would probably witness the emergence of AI/ML devices that facilitate the management of dialysis patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival. © 2020 Alexandru Burlacu et al.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous learning (u-learning) refers to anytime and anywhere learning. U-learning has progressed to be considered a conventional teaching and learning approach in schools and is adopted to continue with the school curriculum when learners cannot attend schools for face-to-face lessons. Computer Science, namely the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents tools and techniques to support the growth of u-learning and provide recommendations and insights to academic practitioners and AI researchers. Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of Artificial Intelligence works in ubiquitous learning environments and technologies to present state from the plethora of research. Method: The mining of related articles was devised according to the technique of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The complement of included research articles was sourced from the broadly used databases, namely, Science Direct, Springer Link, Semantic Scholar, Academia, and IEEE. Results: A total of 16 scientific research publications were shortlisted for this study from 330 articles identified through database searching. Using random-effects model, the estimated pooled estimate of artificial intelligence works in ubiquitous learning environments and technologies reported was 10% (95% CI: 3%, 22%; I2 = 99.46%, P = 0.00) which indicates the presence of considerable heterogeneity. Conclusion: It can be concluded based on the experimental results from the sub group analysis that machine learning studies [18% (95% CI: 11%, 25%), I2 = 99.83%] was considerably more heterogeneous (I2 = 99.83%) than intelligent decision support systems, intelligent systems and educational data mining. However, this does not mean that intelligent decision support systems, intelligent systems and educational data mining is not efficient. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.},

  abstract={Objective: This study provides a systematic review of EU-funded mHealth projects. Methods: The review was conducted based mainly on the Projects and Results service provided by the EU Open Data Portal. Even though the search strategy yielded a large number of results, only 45 projects finally met all the inclusion criteria. Results: The review results reveal useful information regarding mHealth solutions and trends that emerge nowadays in the EU, the diseases addressed, the level of adoption by users and providers, the technological approaches, the projects’ structure, and the overall impact. New areas of application, like behavioral intervention approaches as well as an apparent trend towards affective computing, big data, cloud computing, open standards and platforms have also been recognized and recorded. Core legal issues with regard to data security and privacy still pose challenges to mHealth projects, while commercialization of the developed solutions is slow. Interdisciplinary consortia with the participation of a significant number of SMEs and public healthcare organizations are also key factors for a successful project. Conclusion: The study provides researchers and decision-makers with a complete and systematically organized knowledge base in order to plan new mHealth initiatives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract={Considering the increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the absence of a comprehensive review on it, this research aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of influential AIEd studies. We analyzed 45 articles in terms of annual distribution, leading journals, institutions, countries/regions, the most frequently used terms, as well as theories and technologies adopted. We also evaluated definitions of AIEd from broad and narrow perspectives and clarified the relationship among AIEd, Educational Data Mining, Computer-Based Education, and Learning Analytics. Results indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing interest in and impact of AIEd research; 2) little work had been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into educational contexts; 3) traditional AI technologies, such as natural language processing were commonly adopted in educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both employ AI technologies and engage deeply with educational theories. Findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential of applying AI in physical classroom settings; 2) spare efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between learners’ answers and the desired conceptual understanding within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4) seek the potential of NLP in promoting precision or personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target at issues regarding learners’ during the learning process; and 6) closely incorporate the application of AI technologies with educational theories. © 2020 The Author(s)},

  abstract={Pain relief is a major concern for patients who have undergone surgery, and it is an eternal pursuit for anesthesiologists. However, postoperative pain management is far from satisfactory, though the past decades have witnessed great progress in the development of novel analgesics and analgesic techniques. A Cochrane systematic review showed that patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) achieved better pain relief and greater patient satisfaction than traditional “on-demand” parenteral analgesia, suggesting that it might be the manner of analgesia implementation that matters for effective postoperative pain management. A wireless intelligent PCA (Wi-PCA) system that incorporated remote monitoring, an intelligent alarm, intelligent analysis and assessment of the PCA equipment, as well as automatically recording and reserving key information functions under a wireless environment was introduced in our department in 2018. The practice showed that the Wi-PCA system significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative pain and relevant adverse effects, shortened hospital stays, and improved patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief. Nevertheless, for both traditional and Wi-PCA, analgesics are only administered when pain occurs, leaving behind a realm of possibilities for better postoperative pain management. With the rapid development of machinery and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the mode of clinical decision making. Integrating the big data collected by state-of-the-art monitoring sensors, the Internet of Things and AI algorithms, an AI-assisted PCA (Ai-PCA) may be a promising future direction for postoperative pain management. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Wang, Duan and Wang.},

  abstract={Cardiac arrhythmia is a condition when the heart rate is irregular either the beat is too slow or too fast. It occurs due to improper electrical impulses that coordinates the heart beats. Sudden cardiac death may occurs due to some dangerous arrhythmias conditions. Hence the main objective of the electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is to detect the life-threatening arrhythmias accurately for appropriate treatment in order to save life. Since the last decades, several methods were reported for automatic ECG beat classifications. In this work, we present a systematic review of the current state-of-the-art methods used to detect cardiac arrhythmia using on ECG signals. It includes the signal decomposition, feature extraction and machine learning approaches used for automatic detection and decision making process. The articles covers the pre-processing, detection of QRS complex, feature extraction and classification of ECG beats. Based on the past studies, it is understood that the automated approach using computer-aided decision making process is highly required for real-time detection of cardiac arrhythmias. The advantages and limitations of different methods are discussed and also the future scopes is highlighted in the process of effective detection of cardiac arrhythmias. This study could be beneficial for researchers to analyze the existing state-of-art techniques used in detection of arrhythmia conditions. © 2019},

  abstract={The field of learning analytics (LA) has seen a gradual shift from purely data-driven approaches to more holistic views of improving student learning outcomes through data-informed learning design (LD). Despite the growing potential of LA in higher education (HE), the benefits are not yet convincing to the practitioner, in particular aspects of aligning LA data with LD toward desired learning outcomes. This review presents a systematic evaluation of effect sizes reported in 38 key studies in pursuit of effective LA approaches to measuring student learning gain for the enhancement of HE pedagogy and delivery. Large positive effects on student outcomes were found in LDs that fostered socio-collaborative and independent learning skills. Recent trends in personalization of learner feedback identified a need for the integration of student-idiosyncratic factors to improve the student experience and academic outcomes. Finally, key findings are developed into a new three-level framework, the LA Learning Gain Design (LALGD) model, to align meaningful data capture with pedagogical intentions and their learning outcomes. Suitable for various settings — face to face, blended, or fully online — the model contributes to data-informed learning and teaching pedagogies in HE. © 2020, UTS ePRESS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models in psychiatry, which focus on developing multivariate algorithms to guide personalized diagnostic or management decisions. The main target of these models is the prediction of treatment response to different antidepressant therapies. This is because the ability to predict response based on patients' personal data may allow clinicians to make improved treatment decisions, and to provide more efficacious or more tolerable medications to the right patient. We searched the literature for systematic reviews about treatment prediction in the context of existing treatment modalities for adult unipolar depression, until July 2019. Treatment effect is defined broadly to include efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability outcomes. We first focused on the identification of individual predictor variables that might predict treatment response, and second, we considered multivariate clinical prediction models. Our meta-review included a total of 10 systematic reviews; seven (from 2014 to 2018) focusing on individual predictor variables and three focusing on clinical prediction models. These identified a number of sociodemographic, phenomenological, clinical, neuroimaging, remote monitoring, genetic and serum marker variables as possible predictor variables for treatment response, alongside statistical and machine-learning approaches to clinical prediction model development. Effect sizes for individual predictor variables were generally small and clinical prediction models had generally not been validated in external populations. There is a need for rigorous model validation in large external data-sets to prove the clinical utility of models. We also discuss potential future avenues in the field of personalized psychiatry, particularly the combination of multiple sources of data and the emerging field of artificial intelligence and digital mental health to identify new individual predictor variables. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Study success includes the successful completion of a first degree in higher education to the largest extent, and the successful completion of individual learning tasks to the smallest extent. Factors affecting study success range from individual dispositions (e.g., motivation, prior academic performance) to characteristics of the educational environment (e.g., attendance, active learning, social embeddedness). Recent developments in learning analytics, which are a socio-technical data mining and analytic practice in educational contexts, show promise in enhancing study success in higher education, through the collection and analysis of data from learners, learning processes, and learning environments in order to provide meaningful feedback and scaffolds when needed. This research reports a systematic review focusing on empirical evidence, demonstrating how learning analytics have been successful in facilitating study success in continuation and completion of students’ university courses. Using standardised steps of conducting a systematic review, an initial set of 6220 articles was identified. The final sample includes 46 key publications. The findings obtained in this systematic review suggest that there are a considerable number of learning analytics approaches which utilise effective techniques in supporting study success and students at risk of dropping out. However, rigorous, large-scale evidence of the effectiveness of learning analytics in supporting study success is still lacking. The tested variables, algorithms, and methods collected in this systematic review can be used as a guide in helping researchers and educators to further improve the design and implementation of learning analytics systems. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Intelligent computer systems have been playing a vital role in improving the results of criminal investigations and detections, facilitating analysis and sharing of information. Objective: To identify, characterize and meta-analyze the approaches and intelligent algorithms used to discover patterns on criminal incident data. Method: A quantitative systematic review (with meta-analysis) was performed. Results: 38.53% of the selected studies used Unsupervised Machine Learning, 30.28% used Supervised Machine Learning and 17.43% used Association rules. Regarding algorithms, K-Means (14.39%), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (11.36%) and Apriori (9.85%) are among the most widely used. Conclusion: Only three studies could be selected for meta-analysis, observing the Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms. Being a global problem, the criminal area has attracted the attention of many researchers and scientists around the world. In addition, the Government Open Data phenomenon has facilitated access to data, providing a considerable increase in research in this area. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract={Background: Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data. Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice. Methods: Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant statistics. Results: The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance. Conclusions: We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation. © 2020 JMIR Serious Games.

  abstract={Background: Philanthropists, charity leaders and policy-makers have increasingly recognised that the process of giving resources needs to be grounded in evidence - sometimes referred to as 'evidence-based' or 'data-driven' philanthropy. Yet few philanthropists practise evidence-based philanthropy, and some contend that there is insufficient evidence on which to base their funding decisions. This review aims to identify factors that promote or limit the use of evidence by philanthropists and to rigorously evaluate all existing research on this issue. Objectives: To identify, synthesise, and evaluate appropriate and rigorous research, examining factors which act as barriers to or facilitators of the use of evidence by philanthropists. Methods: This review was conducted according to Cochrane standards and reported following PRISMA guidelines. The review protocol was pre-registered (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.wbsfane). We searched 10 interdisciplinary databases using a highly sensitive search strategy, developed in consultation with an information scientist. We also contacted experts and searched a range of websites. Studies were included if they comprised primary research into or systematic reviews of the barriers to and facilitators of the use of evidence by philanthropists or funders when determining which charities (including health charities or programmes) to fund. All studies were appraised for quality, and the results synthesised using thematic analysis. Results: Of 686 studies identified through database and hand searching, nine met inclusion criteria. The thematic summary identified three main barriers to philanthropists or funders using evidence: (1) inadequate knowledge transfer and difficulties accessing evidence, (2) challenges in understanding the evidence and (3) insufficient resources. The three key factors that expedite the use of evidence are (1) improved knowledge transfer and more accessible/relevant high-quality information, (2) access to professional advisors and networks and (3) broadening the definition of what counts as credible evidence along with standardisation of reporting. Conclusions: The authors of this review found several compelling arguments for promoting the use of evidence by philanthropists to inform their philanthropy. If evidence-based philanthropy is to flourish, then they recommed the following actions: Firstly, philanthropy should be underpinned by a commitment to 'do no harm'. Secondly, the definition of evidence should be expanded and funding decisions based upon consideration of 'all available evidence'. Finally, there should be more investment in synthesizing evidence and in the infrastructure for knowledge transfer.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: Although highly successful, the medical R&D model is failing at improving people's health due to a series of flaws and defects inherent to the model itself. A new collective intelligence, incorporating human and artificial intelligence (AI) could overcome these obstacles. Because AI will play a key role in this new collective intelligence, it is necessary that those involved in healthcare have a general knowledge of how these technologies work. With this comprehensive review, we intend to provide it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad-ranging search has been undertaken on institutional and non-institutional websites in order to identify relevant papers, comments and reports. RESULTS: We firstly describe the flaws and defects of the current R&D biomedical model and how the generation of a new collective intelligence will result in a better and wiser medicine through a truly personalized and holistic approach. We, then, discuss the new forms of data collection and data processing and the different types of artificial learning and their specific algorithms. Finally, we review the current uses and applications of AI in the biomedical field and how these can be expanded, as well as the limitations and challenges of applying these new technologies in the medical field. CONCLUSIONS: This colossal common effort based on a new collective intelligence will exponentially improve the quality of medical research, resulting in a radical change for the better in the healthcare model. AI, without replacing us, is here to help us achieve the ambitious goal set by the WHO in the Alma Ata declaration of 1978: "Health for All". © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are used in a clinical setting to help physicians make decisions to improve clinical performance and patient care. There are many benefits to the implementation and adoption of CDSSs, such as reducing the rate of misdiagnosis, improving efficiency and patient care, and reducing the risk of medication errors. On the other hand, CDSSs can have several disadvantages. For example, physicians can see CDSSs as a threat to their clinical autonomy. CDSSs can also be very costly to adopt, maintain, and support. These advantages and disadvantages can have both positive and negative impacts on physicians. We conducted a scoping review to explore the impact of CDSSs on physicians. We searched the following electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Two reviewers independently selected the retrieved studies and extracted data from the included studies. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. We included 14 studies of the 300 retrieved studies. We identified the following positive impacts: Work efficiency, providing more personalized care, improving care and knowledge, increasing confidence in making decisions, improving prescribing behavior, and reducing the number of ordered laboratory and medical imaging tests. Several negative impacts were also reported by the studies, namely: Inefficient documentation, interruption in the patient-physician communication, and an increase in unnecessary referrals. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.},

  abstract={Background: Consumer-facing digital health interventions provide a promising avenue to bridge gaps in mental health care delivery. To evaluate these interventions, understanding how the target population uses a solution is critical to the overall validity and reliability of the evaluation. As a result, usage data (analytics) can provide a proxy for evaluating the engagement of a solution. However, there is paucity of guidance on how usage data or analytics should be used to assess and evaluate digital mental health interventions. Objective: This review aimed to examine how usage data are collected and analyzed in evaluations of mental health mobile apps for transition-aged youth (15-29 years). Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A systematic search was conducted on 5 journal databases using keywords related to usage and engagement, mental health apps, and evaluation. A total of 1784 papers from 2008 to 2019 were identified and screened to ensure that they included analytics and evaluated a mental health app for transition-aged youth. After full-text screening, 49 papers were included in the analysis. Results: Of the 49 papers included in the analysis, 40 unique digital mental health innovations were evaluated, and about 80% (39/49) of the papers were published over the past 6 years. About 80% involved a randomized controlled trial and evaluated apps with information delivery features. There were heterogeneous findings in the concept that analytics was ascribed to, with the top 3 being engagement, adherence, and acceptability. There was also a significant spread in the number of metrics collected by each study, with 35% (17/49) of the papers collecting only 1 metric and 29% (14/49) collecting 4 or more analytic metrics. The number of modules completed, the session duration, and the number of log ins were the most common usage metrics collected. Conclusions: This review of current literature identified significant variability and heterogeneity in using analytics to evaluate digital mental health interventions for transition-aged youth. The large proportion of publications from the last 6 years suggests that user analytics is increasingly being integrated into the evaluation of these apps. Numerous gaps related to selecting appropriate and relevant metrics and defining successful or high levels of engagement have been identified for future exploration. Although long-term use or adoption is an important precursor to realizing the expected benefits of an app, few studies have examined this issue. Researchers would benefit from clarification and guidance on how to measure and analyze app usage in terms of evaluating digital mental health interventions for transition-aged youth. Given the established role of adoption in the success of health information technologies, understanding how to abstract and analyze user adoption for consumer digital mental health apps is also an emerging priority. © Brian Lo, Jenny Shi, Elisa Hollenberg, Alexxa Abi-Jaoudé, Andrew Johnson, David Wiljer.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning models have shown high performance, particularly in the diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer. However, in actual everyday clinical practice, the diagnosis and prognosis using these models remain limited. This is due to the fact that these models have raised several ethical and morally laden dilemmas. Purpose: This study aims to provide a systematic stateof- the-art review of the ethical and social implications of machine learning models in oral cancer management. Methods: We searched the OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers databases for articles examining the ethical issues of machine learning or artificial intelligence in medicine, healthcare or care providers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis was used in the searching and screening processes. Findings: A total of 33 studies examined the ethical challenges of machine learning models or artificial intelligence in medicine, healthcare or diagnostic analytics. Some ethical concerns were data privacy and confidentiality, peer disagreement (contradictory diagnostic or prognostic opinion between the model and the clinician), patient's liberty to decide the type of treatment to follow may be violated, patients-clinicians' relationship may change and the need for ethical and legal frameworks. Conclusion: Government, ethicists, clinicians, legal experts, patients' representatives, data scientists and machine learning experts need to be involved in the development of internationally standardised and structured ethical review guidelines for the machine learning model to be beneficial in daily clinical practice.

  abstract={Human healthcare is one of the most important topics for society. It tries to find the correct effective and robust disease detection as soon as possible to patients receipt the appropriate cares. Because this detection is often a difficult task, it becomes necessary medicine field searches support from other fields such as statistics and computer science. These disciplines are facing the challenge of exploring new techniques, going beyond the traditional ones. The large number of techniques that are emerging makes it necessary to provide a comprehensive overview that avoids very particular aspects. To this end, we propose a systematic review dealing with the Machine Learning applied to the diagnosis of human diseases. This review focuses on modern techniques related to the development of Machine Learning applied to diagnosis of human diseases in the medical field, in order to discover interesting patterns, making non-trivial predictions and useful in decision-making. In this way, this work can help researchers to discover and, if necessary, determine the applicability of the machine learning techniques in their particular specialties. We provide some examples of the algorithms used in medicine, analysing some trends that are focused on the goal searched, the algorithm used, and the area of applications. We detail the advantages and disadvantages of each technique to help choose the most appropriate in each real-life situation, as several authors have reported. The authors searched Scopus, Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Google Scholar, and MedLine databases from the last decades (from 1980s approximately) up to the present, with English language restrictions, for studies according to the objectives mentioned above.

  abstract={The main purpose of this research paper is to understand how artificial intelligence and machine learning applied to human behaviour has been treated, both theoretically and empirically, over the last twenty years, regarding predictive analytics and human profiling within organizational contexts. In order to achieve this goal, the authors performed a systematic literature review, as proposed by Tranfield, Denyer and Smart (2003), on selected databases and followed the PRISMA framework (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). The method is particularly suited for assessing emerging trends within multiple disciplines and therefore deemed the most suitable method for the purposes of this paper, which intents to survey and select papers according to their contribute towards theory building. By mapping what is known, this review will lay the groundwork, providing a timely insight into the current state of research on human behaviour profiling and its applications within organizational contexts. A total of 17795 papers resulted from the application of the research equations. The papers' abstracts were screened according to the inclusion/exclusion criterions which resulted in 199 papers for analysis. This review showed that 60% of the research undertaken in the field has been done in the last three and a half years and there is no prominent author or academic journal, showing the emergence and the novelty of this research. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

  abstract={This paper reviews applications of machine learning (ML) predictive models in the diagnosis of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases (CDs) are responsible for a major portion of global health costs. Patients who suffer from these diseases need lifelong treatment. Nowadays, predictive models are frequently applied in the diagnosis and forecasting of these diseases. In this study, we reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches that encompass ML models in the primary diagnosis of CD. This analysis covers 453 papers published between 2015 and 2019, and our document search was conducted from PubMed (Medline), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) libraries. Ultimately, 22 studies were selected to present all modeling methods in a precise way that explains CD diagnosis and usage models of individual pathologies with associated strengths and limitations. Our outcomes suggest that there are no standard methods to determine the best approach in real-time clinical practice since each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the methods considered, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), clustering were the most commonly used. These models are highly applicable in classification, and diagnosis of CD and are expected to become more important in medical practice in the near future. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic literature review of learning analytics dashboards (LADs) research that reports empirical findings to assess the impact on learning and teaching. Several previous literature reviews identified self-regulated learning as a primary focus of LADs. However, there has been much less understanding how learning analytics are grounded in the literature on self-regulated learning and how self-regulated learning is supported. To address this limitation, this review analyzed the existing empirical studies on LADs based on the well-known model of self-regulated learning proposed by Winne and Hadwin. The results show that existing LADs are rarely grounded in learning theory, cannot be suggested to support metacognition, do not offer any information about effective learning tactics and strategies, and have significant limitations in how their evaluation is conducted and reported. Based on the findings of the study and through the synthesis of the literature, the paper proposes that future research and development should not make any a priori design decisions about representation of data and analytic results in learning analytics systems such as LADs. To formalize this proposal, the paper defines the model for user-centered learning analytics systems (MULAS). The MULAS consists of the four dimensions that are cyclically and recursively interconnected including: theory, design, feedback, and evaluation. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={As deviations from what is expected, anomalies are typically seen as an obstruction to making good predictions or an impulse to revise the predictive framework. Here, we consider a different possibility—that anomalies, particularly those related to cognitive processing, may be a valuable source of diagnostic information. More specifically, we hypothesize that the extent to which the prechoice information search has been atypical (anomalous) can be used to reverse-infer important latent features of the decision process. For instance, based on atypicalities in how juries examine courtroom evidence, can we infer if they were biased by media reports; or if financial traders browsed public stock market data in a way sufficiently unusual to indicate access to insider information? In our preregistered experiment, participants viewed expert opinions about financial stocks, before deciding whether to invest and get paid according to the subsequent market return, adjusted by an independent random amount. We used eye-tracking and machine-learning dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection techniques to measure the extent to which eye-movements while viewing opinions were idiosyncratic/anomalous. We found that nudging participants by disclosing the return adjustment value beforehand (thus giving them “privileged information”) made their patterns of subsequently viewing opinions more idiosyncratic. With those idiosyncrasies as potential markers of top-down attentional control, we demonstrated a reverse-inference of motivation and prior knowledge from attention, predicting if people were nudged in a particular direction based on how idiosyncratically they then searched for information.

  abstract={Background: Lung transplantation is one of the advanced treatment options performed even in patients suffering from end-stage lung disease. Due to the positive results of medical informatics in other fields of medicine, lung transplant researchers have also conducted remarkable studies to improve transplant outcomes. The main objective of this article was to review the current studies of health information technology used in lung transplantation. Methods: A systematic search was performed in four scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed) from January 2000 to December 2018. The criteria for inclusion were included in any study describing the use of health information technology or medical informatics in terms of lung transplantation, English papers, and original researchers. The retrieved articles were accordingly screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select relevant studies. The survey and synthesis of included articles were conducted based on predefined classification. Results: Out of 263 articles, 27 studies met our inclusion criteria. All included studies involved the application of health information technology in lung transplantation. The types of health information technology methods applied in reviewed articles included mhealth (11.1 %), DSS (7.4 %), decision aid tools (7.4 %), telemedicine (22.2 %), AI methods (11.1 %), data mining (37 %), and patient education (3.7 %). The majority of studies (88.9 %) showed the positive impact of health information technology to enhance lung transplantation outcomes. Finally, the main approaches in different phases of lung transplantation processes were interpreted and summarized in the visual model. Conclusion: This systematic review provides new insights regarding the application of medical informatics in the lung transplantation domain. The missing areas of medical informatics in the lung transplantation domain were recognized through this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that has garnered significant interest in the field of medicine because of its problem solving, decision making and pattern recognition abilities. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, hones in on the ability of computers to receive data and learn for themselves, manipulating algorithms as they organize the information they are processing. Dermatology is at a particular advantage in the implementation of machine learning due to the availability of large clinical image databases that can be used for machine training and interpretation. While numerous studies have implemented machine learning in the diagnostic aspect of dermatology, less research has been conducted on the use of machine learning in predicting long-term outcomes in skin disease, with only a few studies published to date. Such an approach would assist physicians in selecting the best treatment methods, save patients' time, reduce treatment costs and improve the quality of treatment overall by reducing the amount of trial-and-error in the treatment process. In this review, we aim to provide a brief and relevant introduction to basic artificial intelligence processes, and to consolidate and examine the published literature on the use of machine learning in predicting clinical outcomes in dermatology. © Copyright © 2020 Du, Emam and Gniadecki.},

  abstract={Background: There is a need for easily accessible tuberculosis unit cost data, as well as an understanding of the variability of methods used and reporting standards of that data. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to descriptively review papers reporting tuberculosis unit costs from a healthcare provider perspective looking at methodological variation; to assess quality using a study quality rating system and machine learning to investigate the indicators of reporting quality; and to identify the data gaps to inform standardised tuberculosis unit cost collection and consistent principles for reporting going forward. Methods: We searched grey and published literature in five sources and eight databases, respectively, using search terms linked to cost, tuberculosis and tuberculosis health services including tuberculosis treatment and prevention. For inclusion, the papers needed to contain empirical unit cost estimates for tuberculosis interventions from low- and middle-income countries, with reference years between 1990 and 2018. A total of 21,691 papers were found and screened in a phased manner. Data were extracted from the eligible papers into a detailed Microsoft Excel tool, extensively cleaned and analysed with R software (R Project, Vienna, Austria) using the user interface of RStudio. A study quality rating was applied to the reviewed papers based on the inclusion or omission of a selection of variables and their relative importance. Following this, machine learning using a recursive partitioning method was utilised to construct a classification tree to assess the reporting quality. Results: This systematic review included 103 provider perspective papers with 627 unit costs (costs not presented here) for tuberculosis interventions among a total of 140 variables. The interventions covered were active, passive and intensified case finding; tuberculosis treatment; above-service costs; and tuberculosis prevention. Passive case finding is the detection of tuberculosis cases where individuals self-identify at health facilities; active case finding is detection of cases of those not in health facilities, such as through outreach; and intensified case finding is detection of cases in high-risk populations. There was heterogeneity in some of the reported methods used such cost allocation, amortisation and the use of top-down, bottom-up or mixed approaches to the costing. Uncertainty checking through sensitivity analysis was only reported on by half of the papers (54%), while purposive and convenience sampling was reported by 72% of papers. Machine learning indicated that reporting on ‘Intervention’ (in particular), ‘Urbanicity’ and ‘Site Sampling’, were the most likely indicators of quality of reporting. The largest data gap identified was for tuberculosis vaccination cost data, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine in particular. There is a gap in available unit costs for 12 of 30 high tuberculosis burden countries, as well as for the interventions of above-service costs, tuberculosis prevention, and active and intensified case finding. Conclusion: Variability in the methods and reporting used makes comparison difficult and makes it hard for decision makers to know which unit costs they can trust. The study quality rating system used in this review as well as the classification tree enable focus on specific reporting aspects that should improve variability and increase confidence in unit costs. Researchers should endeavour to be explicit and transparent in how they cost interventions following the principles as laid out in the Global Health Cost Consortium’s Reference Case for Estimating the Costs of Global Health Services and Interventions, which in turn will lead to repeatability, comparability and enhanced learning from others. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Improving the value of care is one of the essential aspects of Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) model today. VBHC is a new HC delivery model which is centered on patient health outcomes and improvements. There is anecdotal evidence that the use of decision aid tools like dashboards can play a significant role in the successful implementation of VBHC models. However, there has been little or no systematic studies and reviews to establish the extent to which analytics dashboards are used to support patient care in a VBHC delivery context. This paper bridges this knowledge gap through a systematic review of the existing literature on dashboards in the HC domain. Our study reveals dashboard capabilities as an enabling tool for value improvements and provides insight into the design of dashboards. This study concludes by highlighting a few gaps, question, and need for research in the future. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals in whom the ingestion of gluten leads to damage of the small bowel. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide, but is severely underdiagnosed. Currently available guidelines require CD-specific serology and atrophic histology in duodenal biopsy samples for the diagnosis of adult CD. In pediatric CD, but in recent years in adults also, nonbioptic diagnostic strategies have become increasingly popular. In this setting, in order to increase the diagnostic rate of this pathology, endoscopy itself has been thought of as a case finding strategy by use of digital image processing techniques. Research focused on computer aided decision support used as database video capsule, endoscopy and even biopsy duodenal images. Early automated methods for diagnosis of celiac disease used feature extraction methods like spatial domain features, transform domain features, scale-invariant features and spatio-temporal features. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning (DL) methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machines (SVM) or Bayesian inference have emerged as a breakthrough computer technology which can be used for computer aided diagnosis of celiac disease. In the current review we summarize methods used in clinical studies for classification of CD from feature extraction methods to AI techniques. © 2020 Molder, Balaban, Jinga and Molder.},

This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of RL applications in the critical care setting. Objective: This review aimed to survey the literature on RL applications for clinical decision support in critical care and to provide insight into the challenges of applying various RL models. Methods: We performed an extensive search of the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Studies published over the past 10 years (2010-2019) that have applied RL for critical care were included. Results: We included 21 papers and found that RL has been used to optimize the choice of medications, drug dosing, and timing of interventions and to target personalized laboratory values. We further compared and contrasted the design of the RL models and the evaluation metrics for each application. Conclusions: RL has great potential for enhancing decision making in critical care. Challenges regarding RL system design, evaluation metrics, and model choice exist. More importantly, further work is required to validate RL in authentic clinical environments.  © 2020 Siqi Liu, Kay Choong See, Kee Yuan Ngiam, Leo Anthony Celi, Xingzhi Sun, Mengling Feng.},

  abstract={Background: Sentiment analysis (SA) is a subfield of natural language processing whose aim is to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in a free text. It has found practical applications across a wide range of societal contexts including marketing, economy, and politics. This review focuses specifically on applications related to health, which is defined as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Objective: This study aimed to establish the state of the art in SA related to health and well-being by conducting a systematic review of the recent literature. To capture the perspective of those individuals whose health and well-being are affected, we focused specifically on spontaneously generated content and not necessarily that of health care professionals. Methods: Our methodology is based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In January 2019, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified a total of 86 relevant studies and extracted data about the datasets analyzed, discourse topics, data creators, downstream applications, algorithms used, and their evaluation. Results: The majority of data were collected from social networking and Web-based retailing platforms. The primary purpose of online conversations is to exchange information and provide social support online. These communities tend to form around health conditions with high severity and chronicity rates. Different treatments and services discussed include medications, vaccination, surgery, orthodontic services, individual physicians, and health care services in general. We identified 5 roles with respect to health and well-being among the authors of the types of spontaneously generated narratives considered in this review: a sufferer, an addict, a patient, a carer, and a suicide victim. Out of 86 studies considered, only 4 reported the demographic characteristics. A wide range of methods were used to perform SA. Most common choices included support vector machines, naïve Bayesian learning, decision trees, logistic regression, and adaptive boosting. In contrast with general trends in SA research, only 1 study used deep learning. The performance lags behind the state of the art achieved in other domains when measured by F-score, which was found to be below 60% on average. In the context of SA, the domain of health and well-being was found to be resource poor: few domain-specific corpora and lexica are shared publicly for research purposes. Conclusions: SA results in the area of health and well-being lag behind those in other domains. It is yet unclear if this is because of the intrinsic differences between the domains and their respective sublanguages, the size of training datasets, the lack of domain-specific sentiment lexica, or the choice of algorithms. © Anastazia Zunic, Padraig Corcoran, Irena Spasic.

  abstract={Potential pathogenic factors, other than well-known APP, APOE4, and PSEN, can be further identified from transcriptomics studies of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specific for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Evidence corroboration by combining meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods may help to resolve existing inconsistencies and contradictions. This study aimed to demonstrate a systematic workflow for evidence synthesis of transcriptomic studies using both meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods to identify potential pathogenic factors. Transcriptomic data were assessed from GEO and ArrayExpress after systematic searches. The DEGs and their dysregulation states from both DNA microarray and RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed and corroborated by meta-analysis. Statistically significant DEGs were used for enrichment analysis based on KEGG and protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis based on STRING. AD-specific modules were further determined by the DIAMOnD algorithm, which identifies significant connectivity patterns between specific disease-associated proteins and non-specific proteins. Within AD-specific modules, the nodes of highest degrees (>95th percentile) were considered as potential pathogenic factors. After systematic searches of 225 datasets, extensive meta-analyses among 25 datasets (21 DNA microarray datasets and 4 RNA sequencing datasets) identified 9,298 DEGs. The dysregulated genes and pathways in AD were associated with impaired amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance. From the AD-specific module, Fyn, and EGFR were the most statistically significant and biologically relevant. This meta-analytical study suggested that the reduced Aβ clearance in AD pathogenesis was associated with the genes encoding Fyn and EGFR, which were key receptors in Aβ downstream signaling. © Copyright © 2020 Yuen, Zhu and Leung.},

  abstract={Background: Surgical patients incur preventable harm from cognitive and judgment errors made under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients’ diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. Decision analysis and techniques of reinforcement learning theoretically can mitigate these challenges but are poorly understood and rarely used clinically. This review seeks to promote an understanding of decision analysis and reinforcement learning by describing their use in the context of surgical decision-making. Methods: Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched from their inception to June 2019. Included were 41 articles about cognitive and diagnostic errors, decision-making, decision analysis, and machine-learning. The articles were assimilated into relevant categories according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results: Requirements for time-consuming manual data entry and crude representations of individual patients and clinical context compromise many traditional decision-support tools. Decision analysis methods for calculating probability thresholds can inform population-based recommendations that jointly consider risks, benefits, costs, and patient values but lack precision for individual patient-centered decisions. Reinforcement learning, a machine-learning method that mimics human learning, can use a large set of patient-specific input data to identify actions yielding the greatest probability of achieving a goal. This methodology follows a sequence of events with uncertain conditions, offering potential advantages for personalized, patient-centered decision-making. Clinical application would require secure integration of multiple data sources and attention to ethical considerations regarding liability for errors and individual patient preferences. Conclusion: Traditional decision-support tools are ill-equipped to accommodate time constraints and uncertainty regarding diagnoses and the predicted response to treatment, both of which often impair surgical decision-making. Decision analysis and reinforcement learning have the potential to play complementary roles in delivering high-value surgical care through sound judgment and optimal decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Significant prostate carcinoma (sPCa) classification based on MRI using radiomics or deep learning approaches has gained much interest, due to the potential application in assisting in clinical decision-making. Objective: To systematically review the literature (i) to determine which algorithms are most frequently used for sPCa classification, (ii) to investigate whether there exists a relation between the performance and the method or the MRI sequences used, (iii) to assess what study design factors affect the performance on sPCa classification, and (iv) to research whether performance had been evaluated in a clinical setting Methods: The databases Embase and Ovid MEDLINE were searched for studies describing machine learning or deep learning classification methods discriminating between significant and nonsignificant PCa on multiparametric MRI that performed a valid validation procedure. Quality was assessed by the modified radiomics quality score. We computed the median area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) from overall methods and the interquartile range. Results: From 2846 potentially relevant publications, 27 were included. The most frequent algorithms used in the literature for PCa classification are logistic regression (22%) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (22%). The median AUC was 0.79 (interquartile range: 0.77–0.87). No significant effect of number of included patients, image sequences, or reference standard on the reported performance was found. Three studies described an external validation and none of the papers described a validation in a prospective clinical trial. Conclusions: To unlock the promising potential of machine and deep learning approaches, validation studies and clinical prospective studies should be performed with an established protocol to assess the added value in decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic literature review of the coordinated use of Learning Analytics and Computational Ontologies to support educators in the process of academic performance evaluation of students. The aim is to provide a general overview for researchers about the current state of this relationship between Learning Analytics and Ontologies, and how they have been applied in a coordinated way. We selected 31 of a total of 1230 studies related to the research questions. The retrieved studies were analyzed from two perspectives: first, we analyzed the approaches where researchers used Learning Analytics and Ontologies in a coordinated way to describe some Taxonomy of Educational Objectives; In the second perspective, we seek to identify which models or methods have been used as an analytical tool for educational data. The results of this review suggest that: 1) few studies consider that student interactions in the Learning Management System can represent students' learning experiences; 2) most studies use ontologies in the context of learning object assessment to enable learning sequencing; 3) we did not identify methods of evaluation of academic performance guided by Taxonomies of Educational Objectives; and 4) no studies were identified that report the coordinated use of Learning Analytics and Computational Ontologies, in the context of academic performance monitoring. Thus, we identify future directions of research such as the proposal of a new model of evaluation of academic performance. © 2020 Vilnius University, ETH Zürich.},

  abstract={Background: Given the growing importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as part of “big data” in improving patient care, there is a need to provide a state-of-the-art picture of the added value of using PROs in prostate cancer (PCa) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to synthetize the most recent high-quality PRO evidence-based knowledge from PCa RCTs and to examine whether quality of PRO reporting in PCa research improved over time. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, from April 2012 until February 2019. For benchmarking purposes, we also included RCTs identified in our previously published review of RCTs (2004-2012). Methodology for study identification and evaluation followed standardized criteria and a predefined data extraction form was used to abstract information. PRO quality of the studies was evaluated using the International Society of Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) recommended criteria. Results: A total of 55 new RCTs were published between April 2012 and February 2019. About 24 (43.6%) RCTs were found to be of high-quality regarding PRO assessments. Of these, 13 (54.2%) have been reported in the most recent European Association of Urology (EAU) PCa Guidelines. Overall QoL and sexual, urinary, and bowel function were the most commonly reported PROs. FACT-P, EPIC-26, and EORTC QLQ-C30 and/or its module PR25 were most frequently used as measurement tools. An overall improvement in the completeness of PRO reporting was noted over time. Conclusion: Many PRO trials are currently not included in the EAU guidelines. Our findings suggest that there has to be a better consensus on the use of PRO data for PCa patients, which will then be reflected in the PCa Guidelines and future data collection. Homogeneity in PROs collection and measurement tools will in turn enable “big data” Consortia to increase the patients’ voice in clinical research. © 2020 The Authors.

  abstract={BACKGROUND:  The acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) is the most important cause of mortality in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given that it occurs at the stage of severe tissue damage, its diagnosis is late. With the advancement of machine learning (ML), promising real-time models to predict aGvHD have emerged. OBJECTIVE:  This article aims to synthesize the literature on ML classification algorithms for predicting aGvHD, highlighting algorithms and important predictor variables used. METHODS:  A systemic review of ML classification algorithms used to predict aGvHD was performed using a search of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Springer, and IEEE Xplore databases undertaken up to April 2019 based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. The studies with a focus on using the ML classification algorithms in the process of predicting of aGvHD were considered. RESULTS:  After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 studies were selected for evaluation. The results of the current analysis showed that the algorithms used were Artificial Neural Network (79%), Support Vector Machine (50%), Naive Bayes (43%), k-Nearest Neighbors (29%), Regression (29%), and Decision Trees (14%), respectively. Also, many predictor variables have been used in these studies so that we have divided them into more abstract categories, including biomarkers, demographics, infections, clinical, genes, transplants, drugs, and other variables. CONCLUSION:  Each of these ML algorithms has a particular characteristic and different proposed predictors. Therefore, it seems these ML algorithms have a high potential for predicting aGvHD if the process of modeling is performed correctly. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.},

  abstract={Background: This review article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as it relates to cardiovascular health care. Methods: An overview of the terminology and algorithms used in ML as it relates to health care are provided by the author. Articles published up to August 1, 2019, in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical practice in the future. Results: AI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures. Conclusions: Although there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, and clinical risk prediction, although these techniques require further refinement and evaluation. © 2020 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons},

  abstract={Aim: With advancements in science and technology, there has been phenomenal developments in the application of neural networks in dentistry. This systematic review aimed to report on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications designed for endodontic diagnosis, decision-making, and prediction of prognosis. Materials and methods: Studies reporting on AI applications in endodontics were identified from the electronic databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, for original research articles published from January 1, 2000, to June 1, 2020. A total of 10 studies that met our eligibility criteria were further analyzed for qualitative data. QUADAS-2 was applied for synthesis of the quality of the studies included. Results: A wide range of AI applications have been implemented in endodontics. The neural networks employed were mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in their neural architectures. These AI models have been used for locating apical foramen, retreatment predictions, prediction of periapical pathologies, detection and diagnosis of vertical root fractures, and assessment of root morphologies. Conclusion: These studies suggest that the neural networks performed similar to the experienced professionals in terms of accuracy and precision. In some studies, these models have even outperformed the specialists. Clinical significance: These models can be of greater assistance as an expert opinion for less experienced and nonspecialists. © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons. org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and non-commercial reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

  abstract={Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods: We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results: We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.  © 2020 Avishek Choudhury, Onur Asan.},

  abstract={Background: Due to the high susceptivity of the walking pattern to be affected by several disorders, accurate analysis methods are necessary. Given the complexity and relevance of such assessment, the utilization of methods to facilitate it plays a significant role, provided that they do not compromise the outcomes. Research questions: This paper aimed at identifying the standards for the application of adaptive predictive systems to gait analysis, given the extensive research on this field. Furthermore, we also intended to check whether such methods can effectively support clinicians in determining the number of physiotherapy sessions necessary to recover gait-related dysfunctions. Methods: Through a screening process of scientific databases, we considered studies encompassed from 1968 to April 2019. Within these 50 years, we found 24 papers that met our inclusion criteria. They were analyzed according to their data acquisition and processing methods via ad hoc questionnaires. Additionally, we examined quantitatively the adaptive approaches. Results: Concerning data acquisition, the included papers presented a mean score of 6.1 SD 1.0, most of them applying optoelectronic systems, and the ground reaction force (GRF) was the most used parameter. The AI quality assessment showed an above-average rate of 7.8 SD 1.0, and artificial neural networks (ANN) being the paradigm most frequently utilized. Our systematic review identified only one study that addressed therapeutics including a predictive method. Significance: While much progress has been identified to predict assessment aspects, there is little effort to assist healthcare professionals in establishing the rehabilitation duration and prognostics. Therefore, future studies should focus on accomplishing the production of applications of predictive methods to therapeutics and prognosis, not lingering extremely on the analysis of gait features. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare for pregnant women. To assess the role of AI in women’s health, discover gaps, and discuss the future of AI in maternal health. A systematic review of English articles using EMBASE, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Search terms included pregnancy and AI. Research articles and book chapters were included, while conference papers, editorials and notes were excluded from the review. Included papers focused on pregnancy and AI methods, and pertained to pharmacologic interventions. We identified 376 distinct studies from our queries. A final set of 31 papers were included for the review. Included papers represented a variety of pregnancy concerns and multidisciplinary applications of AI. Few studies relate to pregnancy, AI, and pharmacologics and therefore, we review carefully those studies. External validation of models and techniques described in the studies is limited, impeding on generalizability of the studies. Our review describes how AI has been applied to address maternal health, throughout the pregnancy process: preconception, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal health concerns. However, there is a lack of research applying AI methods to understand how pharmacologic treatments affect pregnancy. We identify three areas where AI methods could be used to improve our understanding of pharmacological effects of pregnancy, including: (a) obtaining sound and reliable data from clinical records (15 studies), (b) designing optimized animal experiments to validate specific hypotheses (1 study) to (c) implementing decision support systems that inform decision-making (11 studies). The largest literature gap that we identified is with regards to using AI methods to optimize translational studies between animals and humans for pregnancy-related drug exposures. © 2020, The Author(s).},

We reviewed research on the effectiveness of three differentiated forms of data analytics: learning, academic and learner analytics. Student outcomes are defined as retention, academic performance and engagement. Our results find that three quarters of studies report the use of educational data analytics to be effective in improving student outcomes but their relationship with student outcomes requires further and more robust investigation and assessment.

  abstract={Introduction: Rare diseases affect approximately 350 million people worldwide. Delayed diagnosis is frequent due to lack of knowledge of most clinicians and a small number of expert centers. Consequently, computerized diagnosis support systems have been developed to address these issues, with many relying on rare disease expertise and taking advantage of the increasing volume of generated and accessible health-related data. Our objective is to perform a review of all initiatives aiming to support the diagnosis of rare diseases. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on methods proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A charting form for relevant study analysis was developed and used to categorize data. Results: Sixty-eight studies were retained at the end of the charting process. Diagnosis targets varied from 1 rare disease to all rare diseases. Material used for diagnosis support consisted mostly of phenotype concepts, images or fluids. Fifty-seven percent of the studies used expert knowledge. Two-thirds of the studies relied on machine learning algorithms, and one-third used simple similarities. Manual algorithms were encountered as well. Most of the studies presented satisfying performance of evaluation by comparison with references or with external validation. Fourteen studies provided online tools, most of which aimed to support the diagnosis of all rare diseases by considering queries based on phenotype concepts. Conclusion: Numerous solutions relying on different materials and use of various methodologies are emerging with satisfying preliminary results. However, the variability of approaches and evaluation processes complicates the comparison of results. Efforts should be made to adequately validate these tools and guarantee reproducibility and explicability. © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background and purpose Machine learning (ML) has attracted much attention with the hope that it could make use of large, routinely collected datasets and deliver accurate personalised prognosis. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise the reporting and developing of ML models for predicting outcomes after stroke. Methods We searched PubMed and Web of Science from 1990 to March 2019, using previously published search filters for stroke, ML, and prediction models. We focused on structured clinical data, excluding image and text analysis. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019127154). Results Eighteen studies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies reported less than half of the terms in the reporting quality checklist. The most frequently predicted stroke outcomes were mortality (7 studies) and functional outcome (5 studies). The most commonly used ML methods were random forests (9 studies), support vector machines (8 studies), decision trees (6 studies), and neural networks (6 studies). The median sample size was 475 (range 70-3184), with a median of 22 predictors (range 4-152) considered. All studies evaluated discrimination with thirteen using area under the ROC curve whilst calibration was assessed in three. Two studies performed external validation. None described the final model sufficiently well to reproduce it. Conclusions The use of ML for predicting stroke outcomes is increasing. However, few met basic reporting standards for clinical prediction tools and none made their models available in a way which could be used or evaluated. Major improvements in ML study conduct and reporting are needed before it can meaningfully be considered for practice. Copyright: © 2020 Wang et al.

  abstract={Purpose: Business analytics, a buzzword of the recent decade, has been applied by thousands of enterprises to help generate more values and enhance their business performance. However, many aspects of business analytics remain unclear. This study explores different perspectives on the definition of business analytics and its relation with business intelligence Moreover, we illustrate the applications of business analytics in both business areas and industry sectors and shed light on the education in business analytics. Ultimately, to facilitate future research, we summarize several research techniques used in the literature reviewed. Design/methodology/approach: We set well-established selection criteria to select relevant literature from two widely recognized databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Based on the bibliometric information of the papers selected, we did a bibliometric analysis. Afterward, we reviewed the literature and coded relevant sections in an inductive way using MAXQDA. Then we compared and synthesized the coded information. Findings: There are mainly four findings. Firstly, according to the bibliometric analysis, literature about business analytics is growing exponentially. Secondly, business analytics is a system enabled by machine learning techniques aiming at promoting the efficiency and performance of an organization by supporting the decision-making process. Thirdly, the application of business analytics is comprehensive, not only in specific areas of a company but also in different industry sectors. Finally, business analytics is interdisciplinary, and the successful training should involve technical, analytical, and business skills. Originality/value: This systematic review, as a synthesis of the current research on business analytics, can serve as a quick guide for new researchers and practitioners in the field, while experienced scholars can also benefit from this work, taking it as a practical reference. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

  abstract={Objectives: Geriatric clinical care is a multidisciplinary assessment designed to evaluate older patients’ (age 65 years and above) functional ability, physical health, and cognitive well-being. The majority of these patients suffer from multiple chronic conditions and require special attention. Recently, hospitals utilize various artificial intelligence (AI) systems to improve care for elderly patients. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to understand the current use of AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML), in geriatric clinical care for chronic diseases. Materials and Methods: We restricted our search to eight databases, namely PubMed, WorldCat, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley, and ERIC, to analyze research articles published in English between January 2010 and June 2019. We focused on studies that used ML algorithms in the care of geriatrics patients with chronic conditions. Results: We identified 35 eligible studies and classified in three groups: psychological disorder (n ¼ 22), eye diseases (n ¼ 6), and others (n ¼ 7). This review identified the lack of standardized ML evaluation metrics and the need for data governance specific to health care applications. Conclusion: More studies and ML standardization tailored to health care applications are required to confirm whether ML could aid in improving geriatric clinical care. VC The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract={Background: Positive economic impact is a key decision factor in making the case for or against investing in an artificial intelligence (AI) solution in the health care industry. It is most relevant for the care provider and insurer as well as for the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. Methods: In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. Results: Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions: This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care. © Justus Wolff, Josch Pauling, Andreas Keck, Jan Baumbach.

  abstract={Objective: To conduct a systematic scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models that use real-world electronic health record data, categorize these techniques according to different biomedical applications, identify gaps of current studies, and suggest future research directions. Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library to identify relevant papers published between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2019. We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges. Results: Forty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N = 13), intrinsically interpretable models (N = 9), data dimensionality reduction (N = 8), attention mechanism (N = 7), and feature interaction and importance (N = 5). Discussion: XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view. Conclusion: Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.

  abstract={Infections encompass a set of medical conditions of very diverse kinds that can pose a significant risk to health, and even death. As with many other diseases, early diagnosis can help to provide patients with proper care to minimize the damage produced by the disease, or to isolate them to avoid the risk of spread. In this context, computational intelligence can be useful to predict the risk of infection in patients, raising early alarms that can aid medical teams to respond as quick as possible. In this paper, we survey the state of the art on infection prediction using computer science by means of a systematic literature review. The objective is to find papers where computational intelligence is used to predict infections in patients using physiological data as features. We have posed one major research question along with nine specific subquestions. The whole review process is thoroughly described, and eight databases are considered which index most of the literature published in different scholarly formats. A total of 101 relevant documents have been found in the period comprised between 2003 and 2019, and a detailed study of these documents is carried out to classify the works and answer the research questions posed, resulting to our best knowledge in the most comprehensive study of its kind. We conclude that the most widely addressed infection is by far sepsis, followed by Clostridium difficile infection and surgical site infections. Most works use machine learning techniques, from which logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and naive Bayes are the most common. Some machine learning works provide some ideas on the problems of small data and class imbalance, which can be of interest. The current systematic literature review shows that automatic diagnosis of infectious diseases using computational intelligence is well documented in the medical literature. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={The current trend in the medical diagnosis world is aiming towards utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical imaging field to highlight what is supposed to be abnormal signs and abnormal structures in the medical image. In our study we construct a systematic review to gather the deep learning algorithms, that have a direct impact with MRI in one single article, to analyze, synthesize and focus on their advantages, and limitations, to ensure that the future researchers will try to get over these limitations, and to take the benefits from the previous. We used Ramey and Rao's that separate the research into two main phases, In the first phase, we are planning to review the published literature on the deep learning algorithms and their impact with MRI, to identify the main algorithms to identify the main limitations and gaps in the current literature. In the second phase conducting the review, this includes how we collect the data, what is the search keywords, the databases where used, and what is inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then we extract the main themes in our researches and build taxonomy connect the whole articles with their themes. And in conclusion we can conclude the deep learning algorithms and their impact with MRI can facilitate the image diagnosis and can also make an improvement on the images whether in resolution or get thinner slice thickness from the thicker one, furthermore, they can enhance the decision-making process that has a direct impact with patient care. © 2020 IEEE.},

This study is of considerable practical relevance as despite having numerous empirical research linking the positive impact of HR Analytics to organizational effectiveness and business competitiveness, the adoption and implementation rates of HR Analytics remain comparatively low. During the time we conducted the research, we faced several issues with the data collection process due to the novelty of the topic but also due to the relevancy and availability of research around the implementation and impact it has on businesses. The results indicate that despite the increase in popularity and interest in HRA, HR professionals still have a long way to go before reaching analytical maturity. Moreover, our research shows that HR is pivoting towards a more strategic function and playing a more curtail role in the organization’s decision making. Workforce Analytics is facing many challenges in regard to its implementation and our study highlights some of these obstacles such as a shortage in data analytics skills within HR, poor IT infrastructure, and insufficient investment from the business. As more organizations integrate analytics into their daily HR operations, we will start to see more challenges and obstacles that will completely change or even disrupt the way we know HR today. Therefore, we urge further exploration and investigation around the implementation of HRA. © 2020, Research Trend. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Mobile health (m-health) is the term of monitoring the health using mobile phones and patient monitoring devices etc. It has been often deemed as the substantial breakthrough in technology in this modern era. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics have been applied within the m-health for providing an effective healthcare system. Various types of data such as electronic health records (EHRs), medical images, and complicated text which are diversified, poorly interpreted, and extensively unorganized have been used in the modern medical research. This is an important reason for the cause of various unorganized and unstructured datasets due to emergence of mobile applications along with the healthcare systems. In this paper, a systematic review is carried out on application of AI and the big data analytics to improve the m-health system. Various AI-based algorithms and frameworks of big data with respect to the source of data, techniques used, and the area of application are also discussed. This paper explores the applications of AI and big data analytics for providing insights to the users and enabling them to plan, using the resources especially for the specific challenges in m-health, and proposes a model based on the AI and big data analytics for m-health. Findings of this paper will guide the development of techniques using the combination of AI and the big data as source for handling m-health data more effectively.  © 2020 Z.

  abstract={The echocardiogram (ECHO) is an ultrasound of the heart used to diagnose heart diseases (DHC). The analysis and interpretation of ECHO are dependent on the doctor's experience. However, software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze ECHO images or videos is contributing to support the physician's decision. This paper aims to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied in the automation of Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) processes, to support medical decisions. The study identified more than 800 articles on the topic in the leading scientific research platforms. To select the most relevant studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, where 45 articles were selected to compose the detailed study of the SRL. The results obtained with the extraction of information from the papers, identified 3 groups of primary studies, namely: identification of the cardiac vision plan, analysis of cardiac functions and detection of cardiac diseases. SRL identifies that the set of Machine learning (ML) techniques are being widely applied in the tasks of segmentation, detection and classification of images obtained from ECHO. The techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), presented the best Accuracy rates. Research shows a strong interest in automating ECHO processes. However, it is still an open research field, with the potential to generate many publications for researchers. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach to understanding and automating goal-directed learning and decision-making. It is designed for problems which include a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. For example, blood glucose (BG) control in diabetes mellitus (DM), where the learning agent and its environment are the controller and the body of the patient respectively. RL algorithms could be used to design a fully closed-loop controller, providing a truly personalized insulin dosage regimen based exclusively on the patient's own data. Objective: In this review we aim to evaluate state-of-the-art RL approaches to designing BG control algorithms in DM patients, reporting successfully implemented RL algorithms in closed-loop, insulin infusion, decision support and personalized feedback in the context of DM. Methods: An exhaustive literature search was performed using different online databases, analyzing the literature from 1990 to 2019. In a first stage, a set of selection criteria were established in order to select the most relevant papers according to the title, keywords and abstract. Research questions were established and answered in a second stage, using the information extracted from the articles selected during the preliminary selection. Results: The initial search using title, keywords, and abstracts resulted in a total of 404 articles. After removal of duplicates from the record, 347 articles remained. An independent analysis and screening of the records against our inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Methods section resulted in removal of 296 articles, leaving 51 relevant articles. A full-text assessment was conducted on the remaining relevant articles, which resulted in 29 relevant articles that were critically analyzed. The inter-rater agreement was measured using Cohen Kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Conclusions: The advances in health technologies and mobile devices have facilitated the implementation of RL algorithms for optimal glycemic regulation in diabetes. However, there exists few articles in the literature focused on the application of these algorithms to the BG regulation problem. Moreover, such algorithms are designed for control tasks as BG adjustment and their use have increased recently in the diabetes research area, therefore we foresee RL algorithms will be used more frequently for BG control in the coming years. Furthermore, in the literature there is a lack of focus on aspects that influence BG level such as meal intakes and physical activity (PA), which should be included in the control problem. Finally, there exists a need to perform clinical validation of the algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={A psychological disorder is a mutilation state of the body that intervenes the imperative functioning of the mind or brain. In the last few years, the number of psychological disorders patients has been significantly raised. This paper presents a comprehensive review of some of the major human psychological disorders (stress, depression, autism, anxiety, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer, Parkinson, insomnia, schizophrenia and mood disorder) mined using different supervised and nature-inspired computing techniques. A systematic review methodology based on three-dimensional search space i.e. disease diagnosis, psychological disorders and classification techniques has been employed. This study reviews the discipline, models, and methodologies used to diagnose different psychological disorders. Initially, different types of human psychological disorders along with their biological and behavioural symptoms have been presented. The racial effects on these human disorders have been briefly explored. The morbidity rate of psychological disordered Indian patients has also been depicted. The significance of using different supervised learning and nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different psychological disorders has been extensively examined and the publication trend of the related articles has also been comprehensively accessed. The brief details of the datasets used in mining these human disorders have also been shown. In addition, the effect of using feature selection on the predictive rate of accuracy of these human disorders is also presented in this study. Finally, the research gaps have been identified that witnessed that there is a full scope for diagnosis of mania, insomnia, mood disorder using emerging nature-inspired computing techniques. Moreover, there is a need to explore the use of a binary or chaotic variant of different nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different human psychological disorders. This study will serve as a roadmap to guide the researchers who want to pursue their research work in the mining of different psychological disorders. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Introduction: Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are recent improvements in infertility treatment. However, there is no significant increase in pregnancy rates with the aid of ART. Costly and complex process of ART’s makes them as challenging issues. Computational prediction models could predict treatment outcome, before the start of an ART cycle. Aim: This review provides an overview on machine learning–based prediction models in ART. Methods: This article was executed based on a literature review through scientific databases search such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results: We identified 20 papers reporting on machine learning–based prediction models in IVF or ICSI settings. All of the models were validated only by internal validation. Therefore, external validation of the models and the impact analysis of them were the missing parts of the all studies. Conclusion: Machine learning–based prediction models provide a clinical decision support tool for both clinicians and patients and lead to improvement in ART success rates. © 2019 Behnaz Raef, Reza Ferdousi.},

  abstract={Background: Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high-risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high-risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. Objectives: To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. Search methods: We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. Selection criteria: Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision-making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision-making. Main results: We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy-based CAD systems (Derm-CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm-CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy-based CAD (Spectro-CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro-CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low-quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta-analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro-CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm-CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI-CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm-CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false-positive results for melanoma. MSI-CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. Authors' conclusions: In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back-up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision-making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face-to-face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

  abstract={Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications presenting by patients diagnosticated with diabetic diseases. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia may manifest as visual impairment and blindness. The early detection of DR is essential to minimize the risk and consequence of visual diminishing. The standard gold diagnoses tool relies on different imaging modalities and requires a judgment of expert photographers, which are not available in most of the primary care centers or remote location. In that scenario, an automate or semiautomated DR screening systems can contribute to improving the accuracy of the diagnostic. Thus, we performed a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis to evaluate the Decision Support Systems (DSS) in diagnosing DR. The overall Diagnostic Odds Ratio was 73.15 (95%CI: 37.54-142.50), sensitivity was 97.70 (95%CI: 97.50-97.90) and specificity was 90.30 (95%CI: 90.00-90.60).

  abstract={Background: Intensive care units (ICUs) face financial, bed management, and staffing constraints. Detailed data covering all aspects of patients' journeys into and through intensive care are now collected and stored in electronic health records: machine learning has been used to analyse such data in order to provide decision support to clinicians. Methods: Systematic review of the applications of machine learning to routinely collected ICU data. Web of Science and MEDLINE databases were searched to identify candidate articles: those on image processing were excluded. The study aim, the type of machine learning used, the size of dataset analysed, whether and how the model was validated, and measures of predictive accuracy were extracted. Results: Of 2450 papers identified, 258 fulfilled eligibility criteria. The most common study aims were predicting complications (77 papers [29.8% of studies]), predicting mortality (70 [27.1%]), improving prognostic models (43 [16.7%]), and classifying sub-populations (29 [11.2%]). Median sample size was 488 (IQR 108-4099): 41 studies analysed data on > 10,000 patients. Analyses focused on 169 (65.5%) papers that used machine learning to predict complications, mortality, length of stay, or improvement of health. Predictions were validated in 161 (95.2%) of these studies: the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was reported by 97 (60.2%) but only 10 (6.2%) validated predictions using independent data. The median AUC was 0.83 in studies of 1000-10,000 patients, rising to 0.94 in studies of > 100,000 patients. The most common machine learning methods were neural networks (72 studies [42.6%]), support vector machines (40 [23.7%]), and classification/decision trees (34 [20.1%]). Since 2015 (125 studies [48.4%]), the most common methods were support vector machines (37 studies [29.6%]) and random forests (29 [23.2%]). Conclusions: The rate of publication of studies using machine learning to analyse routinely collected ICU data is increasing rapidly. The sample sizes used in many published studies are too small to exploit the potential of these methods. Methodological and reporting guidelines are needed, particularly with regard to the choice of method and validation of predictions, to increase confidence in reported findings and aid in translating findings towards routine use in clinical practice. © 2019 The Author(s).},

  abstract={The emergence of powerful software has created conditions and approaches for large datasets to be collected and analyzed which has led to informed decision-making towards tackling health issues. The objective of this study is to systematically review 804 scholarly publications related to big data analytics in health in order to identify the organizational and social values along with associated challenges. Key principles of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology were followed for conducting systematic reviews. Following a research path, we present the values, challenges and future directions of the scientific area using indicative examples from relevant published articles. The study reveals that one of the main values created is the development of analytical techniques which provides personalized health services to users and supports human decision-making using automated algorithms, challenging the power issues in the doctor-patient relationship and creating new working conditions. A main challenge to data analytics is data management and security when processing large volumes of sensitive, personal health data. Future research is directed towards the development of systems that will standardize and secure the process of extracting private healthcare datasets from relevant organizations. Our systematic literature review aims to provide to governments and health policy-makers a better understanding of how the development of a data driven strategy can improve public health and the functioning of healthcare organizations but also how can create challenges that need to be addressed in the near future to avoid societal malfunctions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Wearable motion tracking sensors are now widely used to monitor physical activity, and have recently gained more attention in dietary monitoring research. The aim of this review is to synthesise research to date that utilises upper limb motion tracking sensors, either individually or in combination with other technologies (e.g., cameras, microphones), to objectively assess eating behaviour. Eleven electronic databases were searched in January 2019, and 653 distinct records were obtained. Including 10 studies found in backward and forward searches, a total of 69 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 28 published since 2017. Fifty studies were conducted exclusively in laboratory settings, 13 exclusively in free-living settings, and three in both settings. The most commonly used motion sensor was an accelerometer (64) worn on the wrist (60) or lower arm (5), while in most studies (45), accelerometers were used in combination with gyroscopes. Twenty-six studies used commercial-grade smartwatches or fitness bands, 11 used professional grade devices, and 32 used standalone sensor chipsets. The most used machine learning approaches were Support Vector Machine (SVM, n = 21), Random Forest (n = 19), Decision Tree (n = 16), Hidden Markov Model (HMM, n = 10) algorithms, and from 2017 Deep Learning (n = 5). While comparisons of the detection models are not valid due to the use of different datasets, the models that consider the sequential context of data across time, such as HMM and Deep Learning, show promising results for eating activity detection. We discuss opportunities for future research and emerging applications in the context of dietary assessment and monitoring. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Objective: To carry out a systematic review of studies assessing the effects of chemotherapy prescription clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) on the chemotherapy process. Methods: Articles published in English before May 1, 2017 and indexed in the PubMed and Embase databases were reviewed systematically. Studies that focused on the effects of chemotherapy prescription CDSSs on the chemotherapy process were included in this research and reviewed. Results: 2283 articles were retrieved, of which 37 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven of the included studies reported the effect of chemotherapy prescription CDSSs on medication errors, 18 studies focused on user satisfaction and system acceptance, 10 articles studied the effect of CDSSs on costs and care time and only 3 studies examined the impact on compliance with chemotherapy protocols. Discussion and conclusion: In most of the studies, the use of CDSSs in chemotherapy prescription has reduced medication errors, especially dosage errors and has also reduced the time of chemotherapy process takes. However, in a few studies, the system has not been effective in reducing medication errors, has increased certain type of errors or has introduced new errors. Most of the software used has been specifically designed for the chemotherapy process and is intended to increase user satisfaction and system acceptance. There was not sufficient evidence on the effects of these systems on compliance with protocols and chemotherapy costs to draw firm conclusion. Higher quality studies are required to provide more evidence on the effects of CDSSs on medication errors, user satisfaction and system acceptance, costs, care time and compliance with protocols. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The last four decades witnessed a huge progress in digitizing health information, representing an unmatched opportunity for utilizing health analytics in improving the quality of healthcare and reducing its costs. To learn more about different challenges facing the successful utilization of health analytics, a careful review of literature was conducted, and a qualitative analysis was used to explore and classify these challenges. Three main categories of challenges were identified. 1) Technological challenges; hardware, software, and data content, 2) Human challenges; knowledge, experiences, beliefs and attitudes, and end user behaviors, and 3) Organizational challenges; managerial, financial, and legal barriers to optimal utilization of health analytics. The non-technological problems seem to be harder to solve as well as more time consuming, including the existence of a specific business need and a clear vision to guide the project. In addition, health analytics should always be built with the end users in mind. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) opens an interesting perspective for predicting injury risk and performance in team sports. A better understanding of the techniques of AI employed and of the sports that are using AI is clearly warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify which AI approaches have been applied to investigate sport performance and injury risk and to find out which AI techniques each sport has been using. Methods: Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases were conducted for articles reporting AI techniques or methods applied to team sports athletes. Results: Fifty-eight studies were included in the review with 11 AI techniques or methods being applied in 12 team sports. Pooled sample consisted of 6456 participants (97% male, 25 ± 8 years old; 3% female, 21 ± 10 years old) with 76% of them being professional athletes. The AI techniques or methods most frequently used were artificial neural networks, decision tree classifier, support vector machine, and Markov process with good performance metrics for all of them. Soccer, basketball, handball, and volleyball were the team sports with more applications of AI. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest a prevalent application of AI methods in team sports based on the number of published studies. The current state of development in the area proposes a promising future with regard to AI use in team sports. Further evaluation research based on prospective methods is warranted to establish the predictive performance of specific AI techniques and methods. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Objective: This article reports results from a systematic literature review related to the evaluation of data visualizations and visual analytics technologies within the health informatics domain. The review aims to (1) characterize the variety of evaluation methods used within the health informatics community and (2) identify best practices. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed searches were conducted in February 2017 using search terms representing key concepts of interest: health care settings, visualization, and evaluation. References were also screened for eligibility. Data were extracted fromincluded studies and analyzed using a PICOS framework: Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study Design. Results: After screening, 76 publications met the review criteria. Publications varied across all PICOS dimensions. The most common audience was healthcare providers (n=43), and the most common data gathering methods were direct observation (n=30) and surveys (n=27). About half of the publications focused on static, concentrated views of data with visuals (n=36). Evaluations were heterogeneous regarding setting and measurements used. Discussion: When evaluating data visualizations and visual analytics technologies, a variety of approaches have been used. Usability measures were used most often in early (prototype) implementations, whereas clinical outcomes were most common in evaluations of operationally-deployed systems. These findings suggest opportunities for both (1) expanding evaluation practices, and (2) innovation with respect to evaluation methods for data visualizations and visual analytics technologies across health settings. Conclusion: Evaluation approaches are varied. New studies should adopt commonly reported metrics, contextappropriate study designs, and phased evaluation strategies. © The Author(s) 2019.},

  abstract={Objectives: Several interventions have been proposed to improve medication adherence including those using reminders. Context-aware reminders can be effective because they operate when the dose is due, has not been taken, and is still safe to take. Although very promising, we find that there is no method to design context-aware reminders. To address these, we focus on proposing a method to design context-aware reminders. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of context-aware reminders for medication adherence using PRISMA approach. The analysis of literature leads to several interesting observations including the need for a method to design context-aware reminders. In this study, we present Method to Design Context-Aware Reminders (MDCAR) that can also meet special requirements. We used domain experts reasoning to evaluate the designed Context-Aware Reminders for Medication Adherence (CARS-MA). Further, we used analytical model to evaluate reliability, side effects, and cost of intervention. Results: This is the first paper that addresses “how to” design context-aware reminders. The proposed design method can lead to range of context-aware reminders including CARS-MA. The verification, validation, and evaluation of CARS-MA indicate that the context-aware reminders perform better than simple reminders in improving medication adherence. Conclusions: The proposed method for context-aware reminders will help healthcare professionals and researchers to implement and select a suitable intervention to improve medication adherence. Further, it can lead to decision support systems for patients, healthcare professionals, researchers and policy makers for medication adherence. The design method can be extended for complex scenarios of multiple medications, persistent-reminders, and composite interventions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Majority of the studies employed supervised learning (N = 13), and others employed unsupervised learning (N = 2) and reinforcement learning (N = 2). Among the supervised learning studies, five studies used ensemble learning methods or multiple algorithm comparisons, six used regression, and two used classification. The two included reinforcement learning studies used the direct methods. These results suggest that machine learning methods, particularly supervised learning are increasingly used in addiction psychiatry for informing medical decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background: To systematically review evidence on the feasibility and efficacy of real-time electronic notifications about patients at high risk of emergency department (ED) recidivism. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched for empirical studies of real-time ED-based electronic tools, identifying adult patients at high risk of frequent utilization. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Qualitative data synthesis and assessment of strength of evidence were conducted through consensus discussion. Results: Of 2,256 records found through the search, 210 were duplicates, 2,004 were excluded based on abstract review, and 31 were excluded after full text review. The final sample consisted of 10 studies described in 11 articles describing the effect of real-time ED-based electronic notifications for high-risk patients. Three were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). All notifications were based on prespecified markers of risk. Seven studies integrated complex care plans into the electronic health record. Effect on ED use and length of stay (LOS) was mixed: nine studies reported decreased ED use, although results were statistically significant in only three studies; for LOS, one study reported a statistically significant reduction. Impact on cost and financial metrics was promising, with three (of three studies reporting this metric) showing improved organizational financial metrics. Three RCTs reported a reduction in opioid prescriptions. Conclusions: Real-time electronic notifications of ED providers regarding patients at high risk of ED recidivism are feasible. They may help reduce resource utilization and costs. Large knowledge gaps remain regarding patient- and provider-centered outcomes. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

  abstract={PURPOSE The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools that help to monitor and prioritize the literature to understand the clinical implications of pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance—risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers—or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated data set for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule on the basis of the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule on the basis of the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS For penetrance classification, we annotated 3,740 paper titles and abstracts and evaluated the two models using 10-fold cross-validation. The SVM model achieved 88.93% accuracy—percentage of papers that were correctly classified—whereas the CNN model achieved 88.53% accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3,753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieved 88.92% accuracy and the CNN model achieved 88.52% accuracy. CONCLUSION Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene–cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

  abstract={This systematic literature review provides the association between memory processes, auditors judgement and decision-making process under the influence of cognitive errors. Due to limited cognitive resources, auditors are unable to analyze the population of accounting transactions, therefore, they use sampling and heuristics for information processing. In the context of Big Data (BD), auditors may face a similar problem of information overload and exhibit cognitive errors, resulting in the selection and analysis of irrelevant information cues. But Big Data analytics (BDA) can facilitate information processing and analysis of complex diverse Big Data by reducing the influence of auditor’s cognitive errors. The current study adapts Ding et al., (2017) framework in the auditing context that identify causes of cognitive errors influencing auditor’s information processing. This review identified 75 auditing related studies to elaborate the role of BD and BDA in improving audit judgement. In addition, role of memory, cognitive errors, and judgement and decision-making are highlighted by using 61 studies. The analysis provides useful insight in different open areas by proposing research propositions and research questions that can be explored by future research to gain extensive understanding on the association between memory and audit judgement in the context of BD and BDA. ©2019 ASEPUC.},

  abstract={Background: One of the significant problems in the field of healthcare is the low survival rate of people who have experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Early prediction of cardiac arrest can provide the time required for intervening and preventing its onset in order to reduce mortality. Traditional statistical methods have been used to predict cardiac arrest. They have often analyzed group-level differences using a limited number of variables. On the other hand, machine learning approach, which is part of a growing trend of predictive medical analysis, has provided personalized predictive analyses on more complex data and produced remarkable results. Objective: This paper has two aims. First, it offers a systematic review to evaluate the capability and performance of machine learning techniques in predicting the risk of cardiac arrest. Second, it offers an integrative framework to synthesize the researches in this field. Method: A systematic review of cardiac arrest prediction studies was carried out through Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and SpringerLink databases. These studies used machine learning techniques and were conducted between the years 2000 and 2018. Results: From a total of 1617 papers retrieved from the literature search, 75 studies were included in the final analysis. In order to explore how machine learning techniques were employed to predict cardiac arrest, a multi-layered framework was proposed. Each layer of the framework represents a classification of the current literature and contains taxonomies of relevant observed information. The framework integrates these classifications and illustrates the relative influence of a layer on other layers. The included papers were analyzed and synthesized through this framework. The used machine learning techniques were evaluated in terms of application and efficiency. The results illustrated the prediction capability of machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest. Conclusion: According to the results, machine learning techniques can improve the outcome of cardiac arrest prediction. However, future research should be carried out to evaluate the efficiency of rarely-used algorithms and to address the challenges of external validation, implementation and adoption of machine learning models in real clinical environments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={A neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) provides critical services to preterm and high-risk infants. Over the years, many tools and techniques have been introduced to support the clinical decisions made by specialists in the NICU. This study systematically reviewed the different technologies used in neonatal decision support systems (DSS), including cognitive analysis, artificial neural networks, data mining techniques, multi-agent systems, and highlighted their role in patient diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and healthcare management. Articles on NICU DSS were surveyed, Searches were based on the PubMed, Science Direct, and IEEE databases and only English articles published after 1990 were included. The overall search strategy was to retrieve articles that included terms that were related to “NICU Decision Support Systems” or “Artificial Intelligence” and “Neonatal”. Different methods and artificial intelligence techniques used in NICU decision support systems were assessed and related outcomes, variables, methods and performance measures was reported and discussed. Because of the dynamic, heterogeneous, and real-time environment of the NICU, the processes and medical rules that are followed within a NICU are complicated, and the data records that are produced are complex and frequent. Therefore, a single tool or technology could not cover all the needs of a NICU. However, it is important to examine and deploy new temporal data mining approaches and system architectures, such as multi-agent systems, services, and sensors, to provide integrated real-time solutions for NICU. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective: This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods: We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results: A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions: Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians' experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research. © JMIR Publications Inc.

  abstract={Weaning from mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a complex clinical problem and relevant for future organ engineering. Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) leads to a range of medical complications that increases length of stay and costs as well as contributes to morbidity and even mortality and long-term quality of life. The need to reduce MV is both clinical and economical. Artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) methods are promising opportunities to positively influence patient outcomes. ML methods have been proposed to enhance clinical decisions processes by using the large amount of digital information generated in the ICU setting. There is a particular interest in empirical methods (such as ML) to improve management of “difficult-to-wean” patients, due to the associated costs and adverse events associated with this population. A systematic literature search was performed using the OVID, IEEEXplore, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. All publications that included (1) the application of ML to weaning from MV in the ICU and (2) a clinical outcome measurement were reviewed. A checklist to assess the study quality of medical ML publications was modified to suit the critical assessment of ML in MV weaning literature. The systematic search identified nine studies that used ML for weaning management from MV in critical care. The weaning management application areas included (1) prediction of successful spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), (2) prediction of successful extubation, (3) prediction of arterial blood gases, and (4) ventilator setting and oxygenation-adjustment advisory systems. Seven of the nine studies scored seven out of eight on the quality index. The remaining two of the nine studies scored one out of eight on the quality index. This scoring may, in part, be explained by the publications’ focus on technical novelty, and therefore focusing on issues most important to a technical audience, instead of issues most important for a systematic medical review. This review showed that only a limited number of studies have started to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of ML for MV in the ICU. However, ML has the potential to be applied to the prediction of SBT failure, extubation failure, and blood gases, and also the adjustment of ventilator and oxygenation settings. The available databases for the development of ML in this clinical area may still be inadequate. None of the reviewed studies reported on the procedure, treatment, or sedation strategy undergone by patients. Such information is unlikely to be required in a technical publication but is potentially vital to the development ML techniques that are sufficiently robust to meet the needs of the “difficult-to-wean” patient population. © 2018, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Organizations are increasingly using analytical tools to extract strategic information from data that have been collected over many years, in order to derive a competitive advantage in the global market. The level of use of such tools vary, and different maturity models are used to represent different analytics implementations within organizations. Maturity models have been developed for both business analytics and business intelligence separately. Objective of this study is to evaluate the maturity models developed recently. The business analytics maturity models consider both technical and business aspects. A few models have considered both theoretical and practitioner knowledge. Nevertheless, a lack of consideration for theoretical knowledge in developing maturity models was noted. Most models consisted of stages where maturity is described under each level corresponding to the factors relevant to each stage. Lot of similar factors can be seen among these models. These models act like a road map to achieve business analytics maturity within enterprises. It was also found that the maturity models were developed in a developed country setting. A need for an integrated maturity model with both technical and business aspects, incorporating the theoretical knowledge base and taking factors affecting business analytics maturity in developing countries was established. © IEOM Society International.},

  abstract={Background and objectives: Prompt identification of patients with acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is necessary to expedite appropriate treatment. An early clinical prediction tool that does not require laboratory testing is a convenient way to estimate risk. Prediction models have been developed, but none are in widespread use. This systematic review aimed to identify and assess accuracy of prediction tools for ATC. Materials and Methods: A search of OVID Medline and Embase was performed for articles published between January 1998 and February 2018. We searched for prognostic and predictive studies of coagulopathy in adult trauma patients. Studies that described stand-alone predictive or associated factors were excluded. Studies describing prediction of laboratory-diagnosed ATC were extracted. Performance of these tools was described. Results: Six studies were identified describing four different ATC prediction tools. The COAST score uses five prehospital variables (blood pressure, temperature, chest decompression, vehicular entrapment and abdominal injury) and performed with 60% sensitivity and 96% specificity to identify an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of >1.5 on an Australian single centre cohort. TICCS predicted an INR of >1.3 in a small Belgian cohort with 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity based on admissions to resuscitation rooms, blood pressure and injury distribution but performed with an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.700 on a German trauma registry validation. Prediction of Acute Coagulopathy of Trauma (PACT) was developed in USA using six weighted variables (shock index, age, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation) and predicted an INR of >1.5 with 73.1% sensitivity and 73.8% specificity. The Bayesian network model is an artificial intelligence system that predicted a prothrombin time ratio of >1.2 based on 14 clinical variables with 90% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Conclusions: The search for ATC prediction models yielded four scoring systems. While there is some potential to be implemented effectively in clinical practice, none have been sufficiently externally validated to demonstrate associations with patient outcomes. These tools remain useful for research purposes to identify populations at risk of ATC. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) allow learning to take place anytime and anywhere with little external monitoring by teachers. Characteristically, highly diverse groups of learners enrolled in MOOCs are required to make decisions related to their own learning activities to achieve academic success. Therefore, it is considered important to support self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies and adapt to relevant human factors (e.g., gender, cognitive abilities, prior knowledge). SRL supports have been widely investigated in traditional classroom settings, but little is known about how SRL can be supported in MOOCs. Very few experimental studies have been conducted in MOOCs at present. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic review of studies on approaches to support SRL in multiple types of online learning environments and how they address human factors. The 35 studies reviewed show that human factors play an important role in the efficacy of SRL supports. Future studies can use learning analytics to understand learners at a fine-grained level to provide support that best fits individual learners. The objective of the paper is twofold: (a) to inform researchers, designers and teachers about the state of the art of SRL support in online learning environments and MOOCs; (b) to provide suggestions for adaptive self-regulated learning support. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The extracted knowledge can be used for predictive and/or descriptive purposes. DM has been successfully used in different subfields of eHealth such us cardiology, oncology and endocrinology. This paper deals with the use of DM predictive techniques in diabetes self-management (DSM).To the best of our knowledge, neither a systematic map nor a systematic review have yet been performed with a focus on the use of DM predictive techniques in DSM. Thus, the aim of this study is to classify and review primary studies investigating DM predictive techniques in DSM by summarizing and analyzing knowledge with respect to: year and source of publication, type of diabetes, clinical tasks, DM predictive techniques, and the performance of the predictive techniques used. A total of 38 papers published between 2000 and April 2017 were therefore selected and analyzed accordingly to address six research questions. The results show that Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is largely the type of diabetes that is most concerned by the studies and the prediction of blood glucose is the most investigated clinical task. Moreover, artificial neural networks were the most frequently used predictive technique which along with autogressive models, yield highest accuracy rates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Introduction: Machine learning has been increasingly used to develop predictive models to diagnose different disease conditions. The heterogeneity of the kidney transplant population makes predicting graft outcomes extremely challenging. Several kidney graft outcome prediction models have been developed using machine learning, and are available in the literature. However, a systematic review of machine learning based prediction methods applied to kidney transplant has not been done to date. The main aim of our study was to perform an in-depth systematic analysis of different machine learning methods used to predict graft outcomes among kidney transplant patients, and assess their usefulness as an aid to decision-making. Methods: A systemic review of machine learning methods used to predict graft outcomes among kidney transplant patients was carried out using a search of the Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases. Results: A total of 295 articles were identified and extracted. Of these, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were published in the United States after 2010. The population size used to develop the models varied from 80 to 92,844, and the number of features in the models ranged from 6 to 71. The most common machine learning methods used were artificial neural networks, decision trees and Bayesian belief networks. Most of the machine learning based predictive models predicted graft failure with high sensitivity and specificity. Only one machine learning based prediction model had modelled time-to-event (survival) information. Seven studies compared the predictive performance of machine learning models with traditional regression methods and the performance of machine learning methods was found to be mixed, when compared with traditional regression methods. Conclusion: There was a wide variation in the size of the study population and the input variables used. However, the prediction accuracy provided mixed results when machine learning and traditional predictive methods are compared. Based on reported gains in predictive performance, machine learning has the potential to improve kidney transplant outcome prediction and aid medical decision making © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Database were undertaken. Studies were assessed using the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS) checklist. In total 89,959 citations were retrieved. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were Markov decision-analysis models comparing neoadjuvant therapy versus upfront surgery. Three studies predicted survival time using Bayesian modeling (n = 1) and artificial neural network (n = 1), and one study explored machine learning algorithms including Bayesian network, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural networks. The main methodological issues identified were limited data sources, which limits generalizability and potentiates bias; lack of external validation; and the need for transparency in methods of internal validation, consecutive sampling, and selection of candidate predictors. The future direction of research relies on expanding our view of the multidisciplinary team to include professionals from computing and data science with algorithms developed in conjunction with clinicians and viewed as aids, not replacement, to traditional clinical decision-making. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

  abstract={Background: Medical Information Technology may be understood as an interdisciplinary study of the conception, design, development, adoption and use of Information Technology (IT) innovations for healthcare provision, management and planning. Concerning the use of IT in reproductive health, the aim of the diverse range of currently available applications (apps) is to assist in family planning, antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care, along with neonatal and infant healthcare. End users are healthcare workers or women. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of these solutions have demonstrated promising results reflecting adherence to healthcare services and recommendations, information on management and risk identification in pregnancy, improvement in women's satisfaction with healthcare received, in addition to financial benefits for the healthcare system. Objective: The aim of the present review was to identify main apps and software that are currently available in mHealth, designed for use by health professionals during antenatal care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted through a search for digital health solutions (mhealth/ehealth), apps and/or software, in publications after 2014, during antenatal care provision, in the Pubmed/Medline, Google Scholar databases and Google Play platform. Furthermore, relevant publications cited in bibliographic references of articles selected and unconventional sources (grey literature) were evaluated. Inclusion criteria for analysis of publications or tools were title or abstract descriptions of the following functions: use by health professionals during antenatal care provision, patient electronic record, integration of the app connecting the pregnant woman to the healthcare professional, clinical decision support system and use of mobile technology. The most recent article of duplicated information on apps or mobile health solutions was considered. Systematic review protocol (number CRD42017080501) was registered on PROSPERO in 2017. Results: A search in the Pubmed/Medline database produced 235 results between Jan 2014 and June 2018, 7840 publications in the Google Scholar database; 422 apps in Google Play. The first review of article abstracts and/or descriptors of products available resulted in the exclusion of 8483 sources of data, remaining 14 apps for detailed analysis. Of these, 5 were excluded for failing to meet inclusion criteria or lack of clarity or availability of sufficient data for inclusion. Conclusion: The systematic review demonstrated that it is an arduous task to search for mobile digital solutions that meet the guidelines for clinical use during antenatal care. Although the apps analyzed have great potential for use in different contexts, the bulk of these software systems are unavailable for “prompt delivery”, since the test version cannot be downloaded or access is restricted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The development of Big Data applications in education has drawn much attention in the last few years due to the enormous benefits it brings to improving teaching and learning. The integration of these Big Data applications in education generates massive data that put new demands to available processing technologies of data and extraction of useful information. Primarily, several higher educational institutions depend on the knowledge mined from these vast volumes of data to optimise the teaching and learning environment. However, Big Data in the higher education context has relied on traditional data techniques and platforms that are less efficient. This paper, therefore, conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that examines Big Data framework technologies in higher education outlining gaps that need a solution in Big Educational Data Analytics. We achieved this by summarising the current knowledge on the topic and recommend areas where educational institutions could focus on exploring the potential of Big Data Analytics. To this end, we reviewed 55 related articles out of 1543 selected from Six (6) accessible Computer Science databases between the period of 2007 and 2018, focusing on the development of the Big Data framework and its applicability in education for academic purposes. Our results show that very few researchers have tried to address the integrative use of Big Data framework and learning analytics in higher education. The review further suggests that there is an emerging best practice in applying Big Data Analytics to improve teaching and learning. However, this information does not appear to have been thoroughly examined in higher education. Hence, there is the need for a complete investigation to come up with comprehensive Big Data frameworks that build effective learning systems for instructors, learners, course designers and educational administrators. © 2019 ACM.},

  abstract={An estimated 425 million people globally have diabetes, accounting for 12% of the world's health expenditures, and yet 1 in 2 persons remain undiagnosed and untreated. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing offer promise in diabetes care. The purpose of this article is to better understand what AI advances may be relevant today to persons with diabetes (PWDs), their clinicians, family, and caregivers. The authors conducted a predefined, online PubMed search of publicly available sources of information from 2009 onward using the search terms "diabetes" and "artificial intelligence." The study included clinically-relevant, high-impact articles, and excluded articles whose purpose was technical in nature. A total of 450 published diabetes and AI articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies represent a diverse and complex set of innovative approaches that aim to transform diabetes care in 4 main areas: automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Many of these new AI-powered retinal imaging systems, predictive modeling programs, glucose sensors, insulin pumps, smartphone applications, and other decision-support aids are on the market today with more on the way. AI applications have the potential to transform diabetes care and help millions of PWDs to achieve better blood glucose control, reduce hypoglycemic episodes, and reduce diabetes comorbidities and complications. AI applications offer greater accuracy, efficiency, ease of use, and satisfaction for PWDs, their clinicians, family, and caregivers. © Irene Dankwa-Mullan et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2019.},

  abstract={More and more automated efficient ultrasound image analysis techniques, such as ultrasound-based computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD), were developed to obtain accurate, reproducible, and more objective diagnosis results for thyroid nodules. So far, whether the diagnostic performance of existing CAD systems can reach the diagnostic level of experienced radiologists is still controversial. The aim of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of CAD for thyroid nodules' diagnosis by reviewing current literatures and summarizing the research status.Methods:A detailed literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Libraries for articles published until December 2018 was carried out. The diagnostic performances of CAD systems vs radiologist were evaluated by meta-analysis. We determined the sensitivity and the specificity across studies, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios and constructed summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curves. Meta-analysis of studies was performed using a mixed-effect, hierarchical logistic regression model.Results:Five studies with 536 patients and 723 thyroid nodules were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for CAD system were 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.94), 0.79 (95% CI 0.63-0.89), 4.1 (95% CI 2.5-6.9), 0.17 (95% CI 0.09-0.32), and 25 (95% CI 15-42), respectively. The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve was 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.92). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and DOR for experienced radiologists were 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.91), 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), 4.9 (95% CI 3.4-7.0), 0.22 (95% CI 0.12-0.38), and 23 (95% CI 11-46), respectively. The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97).Conclusion:The sensitivity of the CAD system in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules was similar to that of experienced radiologists. However, the CAD system had lower specificity and DOR than experienced radiologists. The CAD system may play the potential role as a decision-making assistant alongside radiologists in the thyroid nodules' diagnosis. Future technical improvements would be helpful to increase the accuracy as well as diagnostic efficiency. © 2019 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

  abstract={Background: From a therapeutic viewpoint, understanding how drugs bind and regulate the functions of their target proteins to protect against disease is crucial. The identification of drug targets plays a significant role in drug discovery and studying the mechanisms of diseases. Therefore the development of methods to identify drug targets has become a popular issue. Methods: We systematically review the recent work on identifying drug targets from the view of data and method. We compiled several databases that collect data more comprehensively and introduced several commonly used databases. Then divided the methods into two categories: biological experiments and machine learning, each of which is subdivided into different subclasses and described in detail. Results: Machine learning algorithms are the majority of new methods. Generally, an optimal set of features is chosen to predict successful new drug targets with similar properties. The most widely used features include sequence properties, network topological features, structural properties, and subcellular locations. Since various machine learning methods exist, improving their performance requires combining a better subset of features and choosing the appropriate model for the various datasets involved. Conclusion: The application of experimental and computational methods in protein drug target identification has become increasingly popular in recent years. Current biological and computational methods still have many limitations due to unbalanced and incomplete datasets or imperfect feature selection methods. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={The digital transformations and use of healthcare information system, electronic medical records, wearable technology, and smart devices are increasing with the passage of time. A variety of sources of big data in healthcare are available, such as biometric data, registration data, electronic health record, medical imaging, patient reported data, biomarker data, clinical data, and administrative data. Visualization of data is a key tool for producing images, diagrams, or animations to convey messages from the viewed insight. The role of cardiology in healthcare is obvious for living and life. The function of heart is the control of blood supply to the entire parts of the body. Recent speedy growth in healthcare and the development of computation in the field of cardiology enable researchers and practitioners to mine and visualize new insights from patient data. The role of visualization is to capture the important information from the data and to visualize it for the easiness of doctors and practitioners. To help the doctors and practitioners, the proposed study presents a detailed report of the existing literature on visualization of data in the field of cardiology. This report will support the doctors and practitioners in decision-making process and to make it easier. This detailed study will eventually summarize the results of the existing literature published related to visualization of data in the cardiology. This research uses the systematic literature protocol and the data was collected from the studies published during the year 2009 to 2018 (10 years). The proposed study selected 53 primary studies from different repositories according to the defined exclusion, inclusion, and quality criteria. The proposed study focused mainly on the research work been done on visualization of big data in the field of cardiology, presented a summary of the techniques used for visualization of data in cardiology, and highlight the benefits of visualizations in cardiology. The current research summarizes and organizes the available literature in the form of published materials related to big data visualization in cardiology. The proposed research will help the researchers to view the available research studies on the subject of medical big data in cardiology and then can ultimately be used as evidence in future research. The results of the proposed research show that there is an increase in articles published yearly wise and several studies exist related to medical big data in cardiology.

  abstract={Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers that affect mainly women worldwide, and mammography examination is one of the main tools to help early detection. Several papers have been published in the last decades reporting on techniques to automatically recognize breast cancer by analyzing mammograms. These techniques were used to create computer systems to help physicians and radiologists obtain a more precise diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to present an overview regarding the use of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to discriminate masses in digitized mammograms. The main differences we found in the literature between the present paper and the other reviews are: 1) we used a systematic review method to create this survey; 2) we focused on mass classification problems; 3) the broad scope and spectrum used to investigate this theme, as 129 papers were analyzed to find out whether mass classification in mammograms is a problem solved. In order to achieve this objective, we performed a systematic review process to analyze papers found in the most important digital libraries in the area. We noticed that the three most common techniques used to classify mammographic masses are artificial neural network, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. Furthermore, we noticed that mass shape and texture are the most used features in classification, although some papers presented the usage of features provided by specialists, such as BI-RADS descriptors. Moreover, several feature selection techniques were used to reduce the complexity of the classifiers or to increase their accuracies. Additionally, the survey conducted points out some still unexplored research opportunities in this area, for example, we identified that some techniques such as random forest and logistic regression are little explored, while others, such as grammars or syntactic approaches, are not being used to perform this task. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={IMPORTANCE Sources of data in the intensive care setting are increasing exponentially, but the benefits of displaying multiparametric, high-frequency data are unknown. Decision makingmay not benefit from this technology if clinicians remain cognitively overburdened by poorly designed data integration and visualization technologies (DIVTs). OBJECTIVE To systematically review and summarize the published evidence on the association of user-centered DIVTs with intensive care clinician performance. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched in May 2014 and January 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies had 3 requirements: (1) the study tested a viable DIVT, (2) participants involved were intensive care clinicians, and (3) the study reported quantitative results associated with decision making in an intensive care setting. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Of 252 records screened, 20 studies, published from 2004 to 2016, were included. The human factors framework to assess health technologies was applied to measure study completeness, and the Quality Assessment Instrumentwas used to assess the quality of the studies. PRISMA guidelines were adapted to conduct the systematic review and metaanalysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Study completeness and quality; clinician performance; physical, mental, and temporal demand; effort; frustration; time to decision; and decision accuracy. RESULTS Of the 20 included studies, 16 were experimental studies with 410 intensive care clinician participants and 4were survey-based studies with 1511 respondents. Scores for study completeness ranged from 27 to 43, with a maximum score of 47, and scores for study quality ranged from 46 to 79, with a maximum score of 90. Of 20 studies, DIVTs were evaluated in clinical settings in 2 studies (10%); time to decision was measured in 14 studies (70%); and decision accuracy was measured in 11 studies (55%). Measures of cognitiveworkload pooled in the meta-analysis suggested that any DIVT was an improvement over paper-based data in terms of self-reported performance, mental and temporal demand, and effort. With a maximum score of 22, median (IQR) mental demand scores for electronic display were 10 (7-13), tabular display scores were 8 (6.0-11.5), and novel visualization scores were 8 (6-12), compared with 17 (14-19) for paper. The median (IQR) temporal demand scores were also lower for all electronic visualizations compared with paper, with scores of 8 (6-11) for electronic display, 7 (6-11) for tabular and bar displays, 7 (5-11) for novel visualizations, and 16 (14.3- 19.0) for paper. The median (IQR) performance scores improved for all electronic visualizations compared with paper (lower score indicates better self-reported performance), with scores of 6 (3-11) for electronic displays, 6 (4-11) for tabular and bar displays, 6 (4-11) for novel visualizations, and 14 (11-16) for paper. Frustration and physical demand domains of cognitiveworkload did not change, and differences between electronic displays were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This review suggests that DIVTs are associated with increased integration and consistency of data. Much work remains to identify which visualizations effectively reduce cognitive workload to enhance decision making based on intensive care data. Standardizing human factors testing by developing a repository of open access benchmarked test protocols, using a set of outcome measures, scenarios, and data sets, may accelerate the design and selection of the most appropriate DIVT. © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.},

  abstract={Introduction: An increasing number of parameters can be considered when making decisions in oncology. Tumor characteristics can also be extracted from imaging through the use of radiomics and add to this wealth of clinical data. Machine learning can encompass these parameters and thus enhance clinical decision as well as radiotherapy workflow. Methods: We performed a description of machine learning applications at each step of treatment by radiotherapy in head and neck cancers. We then performed a systematic review on radiomics and machine learning outcome prediction models in head and neck cancers. Results: Machine Learning has several promising applications in treatment planning with automatic organ at risk delineation improvements and adaptative radiotherapy workflow automation. It may also provide new approaches for Normal Tissue Complication Probability models. Radiomics may provide additional data on tumors for improved machine learning powered predictive models, not only on survival, but also on risk of distant metastasis, in field recurrence, HPV status and extra nodal spread. However, most studies provide preliminary data requiring further validation. Conclusion: Promising perspectives arise from machine learning applications and radiomics based models, yet further data are necessary for their implementation in daily care. © 2019 Giraud, Giraud, Gasnier, El Ayachy, Kreps, Foy, Durdux, Huguet, Burgun and Bibault.},

  abstract={Visual analytics and visualisation can leverage the human perceptual system to interpret and uncover hidden patterns in big data. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed the rapid production of massive amounts of genomic data and created a corresponding need for new tools and methods for visualising and interpreting these data. Visualising genomic data requires not only simply plotting of data but should also offer a decision or a choice about what the message should be conveyed in the particular plot; which methodologies should be used to represent the results must provide an easy, clear, and accurate way to the clinicians, experts, or researchers to interact with the data. Genomic data visual analytics is rapidly evolving in parallel with advances in high-throughput technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR). Personalised medicine requires new genomic visualisation tools, which can efficiently extract knowledge from the genomic data and speed up expert decisions about the best treatment of individual patient’s needs. However, meaningful visual analytics of such large genomic data remains a serious challenge. This article provides a comprehensive systematic review and discussion on the tools, methods, and trends for visual analytics of cancer-related genomic data. We reviewed methods for genomic data visualisation including traditional approaches such as scatter plots, heatmaps, coordinates, and networks, as well as emerging technologies using AI and VR. We also demonstrate the development of genomic data visualisation tools over time and analyse the evolution of visualising genomic data. © The Author(s) 2019.},

  abstract={Educational institutions are increasingly turning to learning analytics to identify and intervene with students at risk of underperformance or discontinuation. However, the extent to which the current evidence base supports this investment is currently unclear, and particularly so in relation to the effectiveness of interventions based on predictive models. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review and quality assessment of studies on the use of learning analytics in higher education, focusing specifically on intervention studies. Search terms identified 689 papers, but only 11 studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on learning analytics. These studies highlighted the potential of such interventions, but the general quality of the research was moderate, and left several important questions unanswered. The key recommendation based on this review is that more research into the implementation and evaluation of scientifically driven learning analytics is needed to build a solid evidence base for the feasibility, effectiveness and generalizability of such interventions. This is particularly relevant when considering the increasing tendency of educational institutions around the world to implement learning analytics interventions with only little evidence of their effectiveness. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? Drop-out rates and underachivement is a significant issue at most Western universities. Learning analytics have been shown to predict student performance and risk of dropping out. Interventions based on learning analytics have emerged in recent years, some reportedly successful. What this paper adds The paper also reviews and synthesizes the evidence on the effectiveness of learning analytics interventions targeting student underperformance, experience and discontinuation. The paper compares and contrasts past and current learning analytics methods and foci, and makes recommendations for the future research and practice. It critically synthesizes the current evidence base on learning analytics interventions, which is a field that is in constant flux and development. Implications for practice and/or policy The paper focuses on an increasing part of higher education with the goal of validating learning analytics methods and usefulness. The paper makes evidence-based recommendations for institutions wishing to implement learning analytics programs and/or interventions. The paper makes evidence-based recommendations for instructors as well as researchers in the field. © 2018 British Educational Research Association},

The proportion of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in accordance with clinical guidelines was significantly higher in the CDSS group than in the control group (risk ratio (RR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 1.04, P = 0.004). Although the incidence of thromboembolic events was similar between the two groups (RR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.42, P = 0.357), the incidence of major bleeding tended to be lower in the CDSS group compared with the control group (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.01, P = 0.063).

  abstract={E-commerce start-ups have ventured into emerging economies and are growing at a significantly faster pace. Big data has acted like a catalyst in their growth story. Big data analytics (BDA) has attracted e-commerce firms to invest in the tools and gain cutting edge over their competitors. The process of adoption of these BDA tools by e-commerce start-ups has been an area of interest as successful adoption would lead to better results. The present study aims to develop an interpretive structural model (ISM) which would act as a framework for efficient implementation of BDA. The study uses hybrid multi criteria decision making processes to develop the framework and test the same using a real-life case study. Systematic review of literature and discussion with experts resulted in exploring 11 enablers of adoption of BDA tools. Primary data collection was done from industry experts to develop an ISM framework and fuzzy MICMAC analysis is used to categorize the enablers of the adoption process. The framework is then tested by using a case study. Thematic clustering is performed to develop a simple ISM framework followed by fuzzy analytical network process (ANP) to discuss the association and ranking of enablers. The results indicate that access to relevant data forms the base of the framework and would act as the strongest enabler in the adoption process while the company rates technical skillset of employees as the most important enabler. It was also found that there is a positive correlation between the ranking of enablers emerging out of ISM and ANP. The framework helps in simplifying the strategies any e-commerce company would follow to adopt BDA in future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Novel approaches that complement and go beyond evidence-based medicine are required in the domain of chronic diseases, given the growing incidence of such conditions on the worldwide population. A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using "clinical notes," "natural language processing," and "chronic disease" and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions: Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc.

This study examines higher education stakeholders’ views on learning analytics utilisation to support study success. Our main research question was to investigate how ready higher education institutions are to adopt learning analytics. We derived policy guidelines from an international systematic review of the last five years of learning analytics research. Due to the lack of rigorous learning analytics research and adoption, this study examines how ready university stakeholders are to adopt learning analytics. In order to validate the guidelines, we conducted an interview study with 37 higher education stakeholders. The majority of participants stated that their institutions required further resources in order to adopt learning analytics but were able to identify what these resources were in order for successful implementation. Overall, stakeholders agree that learning analytics show much promise to support study success at higher education institutions. © ASCILITE 2019 Singapore University of Social Sciences.

  abstract={Background The design of computerized systems able to support automated detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research. Objectives To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches. Methods A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers. Results The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories algorithm used and support type are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in routine settings are missing in nearly all articles. Conclusions The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives. © 2014 Georg Thieme Verlag.

  abstract={The development of intelligent software in recent years has grown rapidly. Mobile health has become a field of interest as a tool for childcare, especially as a means for parents of children with diverse diseases and a resource to promote their health conditions. Current systematic review was conducted to survey the functionalities of available applications on the mobile platform to support pediatrics intelligent diagnosis and children healthcare. Results which met the inclusion criteria (such as patient monitoring, decision support, diagnosis support) were obtained, assessed and organised into a checklist. In this study, 379 potential apps were identified using the search feature in Apple App Store and Google Play Store. After careful consideration of the selected apps, only three (Google Play Store) and one (iTunes Store), fulfilled all the general inclusion criteria and special criteria, such as intelligence tools. The results showed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) was used minimally in diagnostic apps due to a limited amount of mobile hardware and software, such as the reliable programming of intelligent algorithms. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.},

  abstract={Objectives: Modern critical care amasses unprecedented amounts of clinical data - so called "big data" - on a minute-by-minute basis. Innovative processing of these data has the potential to revolutionize clinical prognostics and decision support in the care of the critically ill but also forces clinicians to depend on new and complex tools of which they may have limited understanding and over which they have little control. This concise review aims to provide bedside clinicians with ways to think about common methods being used to extract information from clinical big datasets and to judge the quality and utility of that information. Data Sources: We searched the free-access search engines PubMed and Google Scholar using the MeSH terms "big data", "prediction", and "intensive care" with iterations of a range of additional potentially associated factors, along with published bibliographies, to find papers suggesting illustration of key points in the structuring and analysis of clinical "big data," with special focus on outcomes prediction and major clinical concerns in critical care. Study Selection: Three reviewers independently screened preliminary citation lists. Data Extraction: Summary data were tabulated for review. Data Synthesis: To date, most relevant big data research has focused on development of and attempts to validate patient outcome scoring systems and has yet to fully make use of the potential for automation and novel uses of continuous data streams such as those available from clinical care monitoring devices. Conclusions: Realizing the potential for big data to improve critical care patient outcomes will require unprecedented team building across disparate competencies. It will also require clinicians to develop statistical awareness and thinking as yet another critical judgment skill they bring to their patients' bedsides and to the array of evidence presented to them about their patients over the course of care. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract={Introduction: Machine learning capability holds promise to inform disease models, the discovery and development of novel disease modifying therapeutics and prevention strategies in psychiatry. Herein, we provide an introduction on how machine learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) may instantiate such capabilities, as well as provide rationale for its application to psychiatry in both research and clinical ecosystems. Methods: Databases PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from 1966 to June 2016 for keywords:Big Data, Machine Learning, Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Mental Health, Mental Disease, Psychiatry, Data Mining, RDoC, and Research Domain Criteria. Articles selected for review were those that were determined to be aligned with the objective of this particular paper. Results: Results indicate that AI is a viable option to build useful predictors of outcome while offering objective and comparable accuracy metrics, a unique opportunity, particularly in mental health research. The approach has also consistently brought notable insight into disease models through processing the vast amount of already available multi-domain, semi-structured medical data. The opportunity for AI in psychiatry, in addition to disease-model refinement, is in characterizing those at risk, and it is likely also relevant to personalizing and discovering therapeutics. Conclusions: Machine learning currently provides an opportunity to parse disease models in complex, multi-factorial disease states (e.g. mental disorders) and could possibly inform treatment selection with existing therapies and provide bases for domain-based therapeutic discovery. © 2019},

  abstract={Background: While the application of learning analytics in tertiary education has received increasing attention in recent years, a much smaller number have explored its use in health care-related educational studies. Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes. Methods: We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation. Results: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis. Conclusions: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies. © Albert KM Chan, Michael G Botelho, Otto LT Lam.},

However, complications, such as graft rejection are hard to predict due to donor and recipient variability. This study discusses the role of machine learning (ML) in predicting graft rejection following kidney transplantation, by reviewing the available related literature. PubMed, DBLP, and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies that utilized ML methods, in predicting outcome following kidney transplants. Fourteen studies were included. This study reviewed the deployment of ML in 109,317 kidney transplant patients from 14 studies. We extracted five different ML algorithms from reviewed studies. Decision Tree (DT) algorithms revealed slightly higher performance with overall mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) for DT (79.5% + 0.06) was higher than Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (78.2% + 0.08). For predicting graft rejection, ANN and DT were at the top among ML models that had higher accuracy and AUC. © 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

CDS systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems. © 2019 Medic G et al.},

  abstract={Ambient Intelligence is currently a lively application domain of Artificial Intelligence and has become the central subject of multiple initiatives worldwide. Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={The purpose of this vision paper is to identify how data visualization could transform healthcare. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are maturing with new technology and tools being applied. Researchers are reaping the benefits of data visualization to better access compilations of EHR data for enhanced clinical research. Data visualization, while still primarily the domain of clinical researchers, is beginning to show promise for other stakeholders. A non-exhaustive review of the literature indicates that respective to the growth and development of the EHR, the maturity of data visualization in healthcare is in its infancy. Visual analytics has been only cursorily applied to healthcare. A fundamental issue contributing to fragmentation and poor coordination of healthcare delivery is that each member of the healthcare team, including patients, has a different view. Summarizing all of this care comprehensively for any member of the healthcare team is a "wickedly hard" visual analytics and data visualization problem to solve. © 2017 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.},

  abstract={This study examined the utilisation of learning analytics to support study success in higher education. The main research question was to identify whether there is a link between learning analytics and the respective intervention measures to increase study success at higher education institutions. The systematic review included empirical studies conducted during the past five years. Search terms identified 6,220 articles from various scientific sources. After duplicated articles were removed, there were 3,163 articles remaining. Each of the articles were screened and the inclusion criteria (e.g., peer-reviewed, rigorous research findings) limited the key studies to 41 articles. This paper presents an overview of the results of this systematic review. It is concluded that evidence can be found supporting the use of learning analytics to support study success in higher education. However, study success may not be exclusively the result of the use of learning analytics but also some additional means of technological or institutional support. The findings also suggest a wider adoption of learning analytics systems as well as work towards standardisation of learning analytics procedures which can be integrated into existing digital learning environments. © 2018 ASCILITE 2018 - Conference Proceedings - 35th International Conference of Innovation, Practice and Research in the use of Educational Technologies in Tertiary Education: Open Oceans: Learning Without Borders},

  abstract={Learning analytics can bridge the gap between learning sciences and data analytics, leveraging the expertise of both fields in exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

  abstract={Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common and probably one of the more consequential complications of critical illnesses. Recent information indicates that it is at least partially preventable; however, progress in its prevention, management, and treatment has been hindered by the scarcity of knowledge for effective interventions, inconsistencies in clinical practices, late identification of patients at risk for or with AKI, and limitations of access to best practices for prevention and management of AKI. Growing use of electronic health records has provided a platform for computer science to engage in data mining and processing, not only for early detection of AKI but also for the development of risk-stratification strategies and computer clinical decision–support (CDS) systems. Despite promising perspectives, the literature regarding the impact of AKI electronic alerts and CDS systems has been conflicting. Some studies have reported improvement in care processes and patient outcomes, whereas others have shown no effect on clinical outcomes and yet demonstrated an increase in the use of resources. These discrepancies are thought to be due to multiple factors that may be related to technology, human factors, modes of delivery of information to clinical providers, and level of expectations regarding the impact on patient outcomes. This review appraises the current body of knowledge and provides some outlines regarding research into and clinical aspects of CDS systems for AKI. © 2018 International Society of Nephrology},

  abstract={Objective Accurate measurement of surgical outcomes is highly desirable to optimize surgical decision-making. An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction. Methods A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. Results Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5% and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15% and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts. Conclusions In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions. However, future studies should investigate how ML can be implemented as a practical tool supporting neurosurgical care. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Background and objective: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most important causes of disability with a high prevalence. The accurate and timely diagnosis of these disorders is often difficult. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can help physicians to diagnose diseases quickly and accurately. Given the ambiguous nature of MSDs, fuzzy logic can be helpful in designing the CDSSs knowledge bases. The present study aimed to review the studies on fuzzy CDSSs to diagnose MSDs. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science databases to identify relevant studies published until March 15, 2016. Studies were included in which CDSSs were developed using fuzzy logic to diagnose MSDs, and tested their accuracy using real data from patients. Results: Of the 3188 papers examined, 23 papers included according to the inclusion criteria. The results showed that among all the designed CDSSs only one (CADIAG-2) was implemented in the clinical environment. In about half of the included studies (52%), CDSSs were designed to diagnose inflammatory/infectious disorder of the bone and joint. In most of the included studies (70%), the knowledge was extracted using a combination of three methods (acquiring from experts, analyzing the data, and reviewing the literature). The median accuracy of fuzzy rule-based CDSSs was 91% and it was 90% for other fuzzy models. The most frequently used membership functions were triangular and trapezoidal functions, and the most used method for inference was the Mamdani. Conclusions: In general, fuzzy CDSSs have a high accuracy to diagnose MSDs. Despite the high accuracy, these systems have been used to a limited extent in the clinical environments. To design of knowledge base for CDSSs to diagnose MSDs, rule-based methods are used more than other fuzzy methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Background Health Information Technology (HIT) has a potential to promote transplant care. However, a systematic appraisal on how HIT application has so far affected transplant care is greatly missing from the literature. We systematically reviewed trials that evaluated HIT impact on process and patient outcomes as well as costs in organ transplant care. Methods A systematic search was conducted in OVID versions of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane, and IEEE databases from January 1990 to December 2015. Studies were included if they: (i) evaluated HIT interventions; (ii) reported results for organ transplant population; (iii) reported quantitative data on process, patient, and cost outcomes; and (iv) used a randomized controlled trial or quasi-experimental study design. Results Primarily, 12,440 publications were identified; from which ten met inclusion criteria. Among HIT systems, uses of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) targeting different aspects of the complex organ transplant care were common. In terms of process outcomes, HIT positively impacted the timeliness of care, laboratory and medication management practices such as promoting therapeutic or diagnostic protocol compliance by clinicians, and reducing medication errors. Regarding patient outcomes, HIT demonstrated a beneficial impact on the percentage of post-transplant patients with normal lab values and decreasing immunosuppressive toxicity and also deviation from the predefined immunosuppressive therapeutic window. However, in terms of mortality, readmission, rejection, and antiviral resistance rates, the impact was not clearly established in the literature. Finally, these systems were associated with savings in the costs of transplant care in three studies. Conclusion This is the first study reviewing HIT impact on transplant care outcomes. CDSSs have mainly been reported to support transplant care in realizing the above-mentioned benefits. However, to make conclusions, more evidence with less risk of bias is warranted. Several gaps in the literature, including comparison of the impact of commercial systems in different transplant settings, was identified which can motivate future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Objective: Sleep apnea (SA), a common sleep disorder, can significantly decrease the quality of life, and is closely associated with major health risks such as cardiovascular disease, sudden death, depression, and hypertension. The normal diagnostic process of SA using polysomnography is costly and time consuming. In addition, the accuracy of different classification methods to detect SA varies with the use of different physiological signals. If an effective, reliable, and accurate classification method is developed, then the diagnosis of SA and its associated treatment will be time-efficient and economical. This study aims to systematically review the literature and present an overview of classification methods to detect SA using respiratory and oximetry signals and address the automated detection approach. Approach: Sixty-two included studies revealed the application of single and multiple signals (respiratory and oximetry) for the diagnosis of SA. Main results: Both airflow and oxygen saturation signals alone were effective in detecting SA in the case of binary decision-making, whereas multiple signals were good for multi-class detection. In addition, some machine learning methods were superior to the other classification methods for SA detection using respiratory and oximetry signals. Significance: To deal with the respiratory and oximetry signals, a good choice of classification method as well as the consideration of associated factors would result in high accuracy in the detection of SA. An accurate classification method should provide a high detection rate with an automated (independent of human action) analysis of respiratory and oximetry signals. Future high-quality automated studies using large samples of data from multiple patient groups or record batches are recommended. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

  abstract={Healthcare provides many services such as diagnosing, treatment, prevention of diseases, illnesses, injuries, and other physical and mental disorders. Large-scale distributed data processing applications in healthcare as a basic concept operates on large amounts of data. Therefore, big data application functions are the main part of healthcare operations, but there was not any comprehensive and systematic survey about studying and evaluating the important techniques in this field. Therefore, this paper aims at providing the comprehensive, detailed, and systematic study of the state-of-the-art mechanisms in the big data related to healthcare applications in five categories, including machine learning, cloud-based, heuristic-based, agent-based, and hybrid mechanisms. Also, this paper displayed a systematic literature review (SLR) of the big data applications in the healthcare literature up to the end of 2016. Initially, 205 papers were identified, but a paper selection process reduced the number of papers to 29 important studies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper assesses workforce modeling and prediction methods by examining their rationale, strengths, and constraints. It aims to identify enhancements for further development of workforce forecasting models and compares the capacity and reliability of different forecasting methods. Past and present modeling trends are described and critiqued based on their relevance to current requirements. Several approaches are reviewed, such as time series modeling and system dynamics simulation. Sensitivity analysis in models is assessed. The models are decomposed into three modes: supply-based, demand-based, and need-based, which in some cases provide substantially different estimates of future workforce need. The chronological progression of models' development is analyzed. The articles are also classified based on the countries and the sectors that have paid great attention to workforce prediction research.

  abstract={Background: Rehabilitation Nursing assumes a fundamental role in contemporary society in the response to the installation of new paradigms of chronic illness and dependence, induced by demographic aging and the advent of a large number of associated comorbidities. Health indicators sensitive to Rehabilitation Nursing care reflect how these nurses contribute to the health of the population in order to achieve health gains. It is necessary to define and contribute to the ontology of aging, which will allow, using machine learning processes, to provide foundations for knowledge acquisition and support for professional decision-making. Objective: To determine the indicators to be included in the ontology of aging, in relation to nursing care of rehabilitation of dependent elderly people in self-care with various comorbidities. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Articles published between 2012 and 2017 were selected by searching the MEDLINE, CINAHL and MedicLatina database, using PI [C] OS methodology, resulting in the selection of 11 articles. Results: We identified 30 sensitive indicators of Rehabilitation Nursing care in relation to the dependent person in self-care with comorbidity. As a proposal for inclusion in the ontology of aging. From the qualitative synthesis of the indicators, improvements were observed in the variables: Readaptation and Functional Reeducation; Wellness and Self Care; Symptom Control; Prevention of Complications; Psychological Support; Customer Satisfaction; Use of Health Services; Quality of Life; Promotion of Social Inclusion; Self-management of Disease and Health Promotion. Conclusions: This systematic review of the literature, which is part of the development of an ontology of aging and its integration into the discipline of Rehabilitation Nursing, aims to provide valid contributions to the corpus of knowledge on which its practice is based. The recognition of indicators sensitive to rehabilitation nursing care is an opportunity for reflection on praxis and a means of conducting to excellence in care and the development of the ontology of aging in international terms. © 2018 AISTI.},

  abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of the mounting research work on learning analytics. Design/methodology/approach: This study collects and summarizes information on the use of learning analytics. It identifies how learning analytics has been used in the higher education sector, and the expected benefits for higher education institutions. Empirical research and case studies on learning analytics were collected, and the details of the studies were categorized, including their objectives, approaches, and major outcomes. Findings: The results show the benefits of learning analytics, which help institutions to utilize available data effectively in decision making. Learning analytics can facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of pedagogies and instructional designs for improvement, and help to monitor closely students’ learning and persistence, predict students’ performance, detect undesirable learning behaviours and emotional states, and identify students at risk, for taking prompt follow-up action and providing proper assistance to students. It can also provide students with insightful data about their learning characteristics and patterns, which can make their learning experiences more personal and engaging, and promote their reflection and improvement. Originality/value: Despite being increasingly adopted in higher education, the existing literature on learning analytics has focussed mainly on conventional face-to-face institutions, and has yet to adequately address the context of open and distance education. The findings of this study enable educational organizations and academics, especially those in open and distance institutions, to keep abreast of this emerging field and have a foundation for further exploration of this area. © 2017, Billy Tak Ming Wong.},

  abstract={The growing healthcare industry is generating a large volume of useful data on patient demographics, treatment plans, payment, and insurance coverage—attracting the attention of clinicians and scientists alike. In recent years, a number of peer-reviewed articles have addressed different dimensions of data mining application in healthcare. However, the lack of a comprehensive and systematic narrative motivated us to construct a literature review on this topic. In this paper, we present a review of the literature on healthcare analytics using data mining and big data. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a database search between 2005 and 2016. Critical elements of the selected studies—healthcare sub-areas, data mining techniques, types of analytics, data, and data sources—were extracted to provide a systematic view of development in this field and possible future directions. We found that the existing literature mostly examines analytics in clinical and administrative decision-making. Use of human-generated data is predominant considering the wide adoption of Electronic Medical Record in clinical care. However, analytics based on website and social media data has been increasing in recent years. Lack of prescriptive analytics in practice and integration of domain expert knowledge in the decision-making process emphasizes the necessity of future research. © 2018 by the authors.

Purpose: This systematic review of literature aims to determine the scope of Big Data analytics in healthcare including its applications and challenges in its adoption in healthcare. It also intends to identify the strategies to overcome the challenges. Data sources: A systematic search of the articles was carried out on five major scientific databases: ScienceDirect, PubMed, Emerald, IEEE Xplore and Taylor & Francis. The articles on Big Data analytics in healthcare published in English language literature from January 2013 to January 2018 were considered. Study selection: Descriptive articles and usability studies of Big Data analytics in healthcare and medicine were selected. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted information on definitions of Big Data analytics; sources and applications of Big Data analytics in healthcare; challenges and strategies to overcome the challenges in healthcare. Results: A total of 58 articles were selected as per the inclusion criteria and analyzed. The analyses of these articles found that: (1) researchers lack consensus about the operational definition of Big Data in healthcare; (2) Big Data in healthcare comes from the internal sources within the hospitals or clinics as well external sources including government, laboratories, pharma companies, data aggregators, medical journals etc.; (3) natural language processing (NLP) is most widely used Big Data analytical technique for healthcare and most of the processing tools used for analytics are based on Hadoop; (4) Big Data analytics finds its application for clinical decision support; optimization of clinical operations and reduction of cost of care (5) major challenge in adoption of Big Data analytics is non-availability of evidence of its practical benefits in healthcare. Conclusion: This review study unveils that there is a paucity of information on evidence of real-world use of Big Data analytics in healthcare. This is because, the usability studies have considered only qualitative approach which describes potential benefits but does not take into account the quantitative study. Also, majority of the studies were from developed countries which brings out the need for promotion of research on Healthcare Big Data analytics in developing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={The new digital health innovations have opened up several opportunities to help the clinicians, patients and other caregivers of rheumatology healthcare system in maximizing efficiencies resulting in better patient outcomes. In the global context, digital health technology has the potential to bridge the distance gap between all the key stakeholders involved in rheumatology health care. In this review, we update on the recent advances in the field of digital health and highlight unique features of these technologies which would help in routine care. Application of technology in any form to enable, facilitate or enhance the quality of care is the foundation of digitised care. The components could be smartphone apps, sensors, video, social media platforms or messenger platforms, wearables or a combination of these enabling healthcare delivery and overcoming the constraints of distance, location and time. Digital therapeutics have started evolving and an important step in this direction is the involvement of FDA in the approval process. Speciality specific apps, personalised patient education as per disease status, remote specialist consultations or virtual health coach to guide on lifestyle modifications are some of the developments which have been facilitated by increased digitization in all walks of life. Assisted care with the help of robots rendering care in the hospitals or an intelligent robot guiding a patient by voice and visual sense at home are already at the threshold of entering the mainstream of patient care. Wearable devices equipped with powerful sensors are coming handy in keeping a watch on patient symptoms all the time and providing useful insights on disease progression, clinical response or complications. In chronic care such as rheumatology the implications, possibilities and benefits seem unprecedented. Real time data analytics and artificial intelligence are helping the clinicians, healthcare systems and policy makers optimise the resources and improve patient outcomes. Digitization of healthcare has gained momentum in the recent years and it is envisaged that it could be a catalyst to change, bridge the quality of care and most important democratise the healthcare access across the globe. However, more data, efficacy and objective results are needed which would be fulfilled by ongoing observational studies, clinical trials, systematic review and meta-analysis to further establish the role of digital health in the realms of patient care. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background and Objective: Diagnosis as the initial step of medical practice, is one of the most important parts of complicated clinical decision making which is usually accompanied with the degree of ambiguity and uncertainty. Since uncertainty is the inseparable nature of medicine, fuzzy logic methods have been used as one of the best methods to decrease this ambiguity. Recently, several kinds of literature have been published related to fuzzy logic methods in a wide range of medical aspects in terms of diagnosis. However, in this context there are a few review articles that have been published which belong to almost ten years ago. Hence, we conducted a systematic review to determine the contribution of utilizing fuzzy logic methods in disease diagnosis in different medical practices. Methods: Eight scientific databases are selected as an appropriate database and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was employed as the basis method for conducting this systematic and meta-analysis review. Regarding the main objective of this research, some inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered to limit our investigation. To achieve a structured meta-analysis, all eligible articles were classified based on authors, publication year, journals or conferences, applied fuzzy methods, main objectives of the research, problems and research gaps, tools utilized to model the fuzzy system, medical disciplines, sample sizes, the inputs and outputs of the system, findings, results and finally the impact of applied fuzzy methods to improve diagnosis. Then, we analyzed the results obtained from these classifications to indicate the effect of fuzzy methods in decreasing the complexity of diagnosis. Results: Consequently, the result of this study approved the effectiveness of applying different fuzzy methods in diseases diagnosis process, presenting new insights for researchers about what kind of diseases which have been more focused. This will help to determine the diagnostic aspects of medical disciplines that are being neglected. Conclusions: Overall, this systematic review provides an appropriate platform for further research by identifying the research needs in the domain of disease diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Introduction: Kidney stone disease (KSD) affects millions of people worldwide and has an increasing incidence. Social media (SoMe) and search engines are both gaining in usage, while also being used by patients to research their conditions and aid in managing them. With this in mind, many authors have expressed the belief that SoMe and search engines can be used by patients and healthcare professionals to improve treatment compliance and help counseling and management of conditions such as KSD. We wanted to determine whether SoMe and search engines play a role in the management and/or prevention of KSD. Materials and Methods: The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were used to search for relevant English language literature from inception to December 2017. Results were screened by title, abstract, and then full text, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data were then analyzed independently by the authors not involved in the original study. Results: After initial identification of 2137 records and screening of 42 articles, 10 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles included focused on a variety of SoMe forms, including two articles each on twitter, YouTube, smartphone apps, and Google search engine and one article on Google insights and Google analytics. Regarding patient centered advice, while two articles covered advice on dietary, fluid intake, and management options, two additional articles each covered advice on fluid advice and management options only, while no such advice was given by three of the SoMe published articles. Conclusions: SoMe and search engines provide valuable information to patients with KSD. However, while the information provided regarding dietary aspects and fluid management was good, it was not comprehensive enough to include advice on other aspects of KSD prevention. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

  abstract={Objectives: Smartphones represent a promising technology for patient-centered healthcare. It is claimed that data mining techniques have improved mobile apps to address patients’ needs at subgroup and individual levels. This study reviewed the current literature regarding data mining applications in patient-centered mobile-based information systems. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for original studies reported from 2014 to 2016. After screening 226 records at the title/abstract level, the full texts of 92 relevant papers were retrieved and checked against inclusion criteria. Finally, 30 papers were included in this study and reviewed. Results: Data mining techniques have been reported in development of mobile health apps for three main purposes: data analysis for follow-up and monitoring, early diagnosis and detection for screening purpose, classification/prediction of outcomes, and risk calculation (n = 27); data collection (n = 3); and provision of recommendations (n = 2). The most accurate and frequently applied data mining method was support vector machine; however, decision tree has shown superior performance to enhance mobile apps applied for patients’ self-management. Conclusions: Embedded data-mining-based feature in mobile apps, such as case detection, prediction/classification, risk estimation, or collection of patient data, particularly during self-management, would save, apply, and analyze patient data during and after care. More intelligent methods, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, and even the hybrid methods may result in more patients-centered recommendations, providing education, guidance, alerts, and awareness of personalized output. © 2017 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.},

  abstract={Background Dementia is a complex disorder characterized by poor outcomes for the patients and high costs of care. After decades of research little is known about its mechanisms. Having prognostic estimates about dementia can help researchers, patients and public entities in dealing with this disorder. Thus, health data, machine learning and microsimulation techniques could be employed in developing prognostic estimates for dementia. Objective The goal of this paper is to present evidence on the state of the art of studies investigating and the prognosis of dementia using machine learning and microsimulation techniques. Method To achieve our goal we carried out a systematic literature review, in which three large databases -Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science were searched to select studies that employed machine learning or microsimulation techniques for the prognosis of dementia. A single backward snowballing was done to identify further studies. A quality checklist was also employed to assess the quality of the evidence presented by the selected studies, and low quality studies were removed. Finally, data from the final set of studies were extracted in summary tables. Results In total 37 papers were included. The data summary results showed that the current research is focused on the investigation of the patients with mild cognitive impairment that will evolve to Alzheimer's disease, using machine learning techniques. Microsimulation studies were concerned with cost estimation and had a populational focus. Neuroimaging was the most commonly used variable. Conclusions Prediction of conversion from MCI to AD is the dominant theme in the selected studies. Most studies used ML techniques on Neuroimaging data. Only a few data sources have been recruited by most studies and the ADNI database is the one most commonly used. Only two studies have investigated the prediction of epidemiological aspects of Dementia using either ML or MS techniques. Finally, care should be taken when interpreting the reported accuracy of ML techniques, given studies' different contexts. © 2017 Dallora et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

  abstract={The current immunosuppressive pipeline in kidney transplantation is limited. In part, this is due to excellent one-year allograft outcomes with the current standard of care (ie, calcineurin inhibitor in combination with anti-proliferative agents). Despite this success, a recent Federal government–sponsored systematic review has identified gaps/limits in the evidence of what constitutes optimal calcineurin inhibitor use in the short- and long-term. Moreover, recent empiric approaches to minimize/withdraw/convert from calcineurin inhibitors have come with the price of increased alloreactivity. As the time horizon to replace calcineurin inhibitors on a global scale may be distant, the transplant community should seize the opportunity to develop ways to personalize calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppression to the individual—transitioning from empiricism to precision. The authors argue in this viewpoint that the path to precision will require measures capable of detecting subclinical alloreactivity to define adequacy of immunosuppression, as well as novel genetic analytics to accurately define alloimmune risk at the individual level—both approaches will require validation in clinical trials. © 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons},

  abstract={It has been long argued that learning analytics has the potential to act as a “middle space” between the learning sciences and data analytics, creating technical possibilities for exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. One common learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a support tool for teachers and learners alike that allows them to gain insight into the learning process. Although several related works have scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards, none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our critical examination reveals the most common educational concepts and the context in which they have been applied. We find evidence that current designs foster competition between learners rather than knowledge mastery, offering misguided frames of reference for comparison. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract={Background A growing literature has demonstrated the ability of user-centered design to make clinical decision support systems more effective and easier to use. However, studies of user-centered design have rarely examined more than a handful of sites at a time, and have frequently neglected the implementation climate and organizational resources that influence clinical decision support. The inclusion of such factors was identified by a systematic review as “the most important improvement that can be made in health IT evaluations.” Objectives (1) Identify the prevalence of four user-centered design practices at United States Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care clinics and assess the perceived utility of clinical decision support at those clinics; (2) Evaluate the association between those user-centered design practices and the perceived utility of clinical decision support. Methods We analyzed clinic-level survey data collected in 2006–2007 from 170 VA primary care clinics. We examined four user-centered design practices: 1) pilot testing, 2) provider satisfaction assessment, 3) formal usability assessment, and 4) analysis of impact on performance improvement. We used a regression model to evaluate the association between user-centered design practices and the perceived utility of clinical decision support, while accounting for other important factors at those clinics, including implementation climate, available resources, and structural characteristics. We also examined associations separately at community-based clinics and at hospital-based clinics. Results User-centered design practices for clinical decision support varied across clinics: 74% conducted pilot testing, 62% conducted provider satisfaction assessment, 36% conducted a formal usability assessment, and 79% conducted an analysis of impact on performance improvement. Overall perceived utility of clinical decision support was high, with a mean rating of 4.17 (±.67) out of 5 on a composite measure. “Analysis of impact on performance improvement” was the only user-centered design practice significantly associated with perceived utility of clinical decision support, b = .47 (p < .001). This association was present in hospital-based clinics, b = .34 (p < .05), but was stronger at community-based clinics, b =.61 (p < .001). Conclusions Our findings are highly supportive of the practice of analyzing the impact of clinical decision support on performance metrics. This was the most common user-centered design practice in our study, and was the practice associated with higher perceived utility of clinical decision support. This practice may be particularly helpful at community-based clinics, which are typically less connected to VA medical center resources. © 2017},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are common intracranial pathologies encountered by neurosurgeons. They often may have similar radiological findings, making diagnosis difficult without surgical biopsy; however, management is quite different between these two entities. Recently, predictive analytics, including machine learning (ML), have garnered attention for their potential to aid in the diagnostic assessment of a variety of pathologies. Several ML algorithms have recently been designed to differentiate GBM from PCNSL radiologically with a high sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the implementation of ML algorithms in differentiating GBM and PCNSL. METHODS The authors performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to select and evaluate studies that included themes of ML and brain tumors. These studies were further narrowed down to focus on works published between January 2008 and May 2018 addressing the use of ML in training models to distinguish between GBM and PCNSL on radiological imaging. Outcomes assessed were test characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS Eight studies were identified addressing use of ML in training classifiers to distinguish between GBM and PCNSL on radiological imaging. ML performed well with the lowest reported AUC being 0.878. In studies in which ML was directly compared with radiologists, ML performed better than or as well as the radiologists. However, when ML was applied to an external data set, it performed more poorly. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have applied ML to solve the problem of differentiating GBM from PCNSL using imaging alone. Of the currently published studies, ML algorithms have demonstrated promising results and certainly have the potential to aid radiologists with difficult cases, which could expedite the neurosurgical decision-making process. It is likely that ML algorithms will help to optimize neurosurgical patient outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of neurosurgical care if the problem of overfitting can be overcome. © AANS 2018.},

  abstract={Objectives To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of different categories of interruptive medication prescribing alerts to change prescriber behavior and/or improve patient outcomes in hospital computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. Methods PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and February 2016. Studies were included if they compared the outcomes of automatic, interruptive medication prescribing alert/s to a control/comparison group to determine alert effectiveness. Results Twenty-three studies describing 32 alerts classified into 11 alert categories were identified. The most common alert categories studied were drug-condition interaction (n = 6), drug-drug interaction alerts (n = 6) and corollary order alerts (n = 6). All 23 papers investigated the effect of the intervention alert on at least one outcome measure of prescriber behavior. Just over half of the studies (53%, n = 17) reported a statistically significant beneficial effect from the intervention alert; 34% (n = 11) reported no statistically significant effect, and 6% (n = 2) reported a significant detrimental effect. Two studies also evaluated the effect of alerts on patient outcome measures; neither finding that patient outcomes significantly improved following alert implementation (6%, n = 2). The greatest volume of evidence relates to three alert categories: drug-condition, drug-drug and corollary order alerts. Of these, drug-condition alerts had the greatest number of studies reporting positive effects (five out of six studies). Only two of six studies of drug-drug interaction and one of six of corollary alerts reported positive benefits. Discussion and conclusion The current evidence-base does not show a clear indication that particular categories of alerts are more effective than others. While the majority of alert categories were shown to improve outcomes in some studies, there were also many cases where outcomes did not improve. This lack of evidence hinders decisions about the amount and type of decision support that should be integrated into CPOE systems to increase safety while reducing the risk of alert fatigue. Virtually no studies have sought to investigate the impact on changes to prescriber behavior and outcomes overall when alerts from multiple categories are incorporated within the same system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Improving diagnosis and treatment depends on clinical monitoring and computing. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been in existence for over 50 years. While the literature points to positive impacts on quality and patient safety, outcomes, and the avoidance of medical errors, technical and regulatory challenges continue to retard their rate of integration into clinical care processes and thus delay the refinement of diagnoses towards personalized care. We conducted a systematic review of pertinent articles in the MEDLINE, US Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Health Research and Quality, and US Food and Drug Administration databases, using a Boolean approach to combine terms germane to the discussion (clinical decision support, tools, systems, critical care, trauma, outcome, cost savings, NSQIP, APACHE, SOFA, ICU, and diagnostics). References were selected on the basis of both temporal and thematic relevance, and subsequently aggregated around four distinct themes: the uses of CDSS in the critical and surgical care settings, clinical insertion challenges, utilization leading to cost-savings, and regulatory concerns. Precision diagnosis is the accurate and timely explanation of each patient’s health problem and further requires communication of that explanation to patients and surrogate decision-makers. Both accuracy and timeliness are essential to critical care, yet computed decision support systems (CDSS) are scarce. The limitation arises from the technical complexity associated with integrating and filtering large data sets from diverse sources. Provider mistrust and resistance coupled with the absence of clear guidance from regulatory bodies further retard acceptance of CDSS. While challenges to develop and deploy CDSS are substantial, the clinical, quality, and economic impacts warrant the effort, especially in disciplines requiring complex decision-making, such as critical and surgical care. Improving diagnosis in health care requires accumulation, validation and transformation of data into actionable information. The aggregate of those processes—CDSS—is currently primitive. Despite technical and regulatory challenges, the apparent clinical and economic utilities of CDSS must lead to greater engagement. These tools play the key role in realizing the vision of a more ‘personalized medicine’, one characterized by individualized precision diagnosis rather than population-based risk-stratification. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We also highlight ongoing research and identify open challenges in building deep learning models of EHRs. Design/method We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for papers on deep learning studies using EHR data published between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2018. We summarize them according to these axes: Types of analytics tasks, types of deep learning model architectures, special challenges arising from health data and tasks and their potential solutions, as well as evaluation strategies. Results We surveyed and analyzed multiple aspects of the 98 articles we found and identified the following analytics tasks: disease detection/classification, sequential prediction of clinical events, concept embedding, data augmentation, and EHR data privacy. We then studied how deep architectures were applied to these tasks. We also discussed some special challenges arising from modeling EHR data and reviewed a few popular approaches. Finally, we summarized how performance evaluations were conducted for each task. Discussion Despite the early success in using deep learning for health analytics applications, there still exist a number of issues to be addressed. We discuss them in detail including data and label availability, the interpretability and transparency of the model, and ease of deployment. © © The Author(s) 2018.

  abstract={With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today’s increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract={The rising incidence of mental illness and its impact on individuals,families,and societies is becoming a major public health concern,especially in resource-constrained countries.Consequently,there is an increasing demand formental health services in many middle-and low-income countries (LMIC). Challenges such as inequality in access,lack of staff and hospital beds,and underfunding, often present in the LMIC, might in part be addressed by telemental health services. However,little is known about telemental health in the LMIC.Methods.Asystematic reviewwas performed,drawing on several electronic databases, including PubMed,PsycINFO,Web of Science, Springer Link,andGoogle Scholar.Original English language studies on the practice of telemental health in LMIC, involving patients and published between 1 January 2000 and 16 February 2017,were included.Results.Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria.Most of the articles were recent,which may reflect an increasing focus on telemental health in the LMIC. Eight of these studieswere fromAsia. Eight of the studieswere interventional/randomized controlled trials, and 11 examined general mental health issues. Videoconferencing was the most frequently (6) studied telemental modality. Other modalities studied were online decision support systems(3),text messaging and bibliotherapy (1),e-chatting combined with videoconferencing(1),online therapy (2),e-counseling(1),store-and-forward technology(1),telephone follow-up (1), online discussion groups(1),audiovisual therapy and bibliotherapy (1),and computerized occupational therapy(1).Although many of the studies showed that telemental services had positive outcomes, some studies reported no postintervention improvements.Conclusion. The review shows a rising trend in telemental activity in the LMIC. There is a greater need for telemental health in the LMIC, but more research is needed on empirical and theoretical aspects of telemental activity in the LMIC and on direct comparisons between telemental activity in the LMIC and the non-LMIC. © 2018 JeremiahW.Acharibasamand RolfWynn.},

  abstract={Most of the decisions in medical diagnosis are taken on the basis of experts' opinions. In the case of heart diseases, however, the experts' decisions do not always reach a consensus since the pattern of heart disorders varies considerably among patients. Researchers have been making continuous efforts to detect heart diseases at the primary stages by using different methodologies in order to increase the chances of curing a condition that has one of the highest mortality rates in the world. The three main objectives of this study were to analyze the global impact of heart diseases on the basis of mortality rates, to assess the risk of heart diseases in different age groups, and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of methodologies that have been used previously for predicting heart disease at the primary stage. The mortality rate due to heart diseases was assessed according to attributes such as age, population group, clinical risk factors, and geographical locations. Different methodologies were analyzed on the basis of results obtained from literature searches in IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, and other publications. The percentage of deaths due to heart diseases increase with age, indicating that the risk of developing heart disease is directly proportional to age. The analysis of various methodological approaches indicated that data mining and the combination of optimization methods can be effective in predicting heart disease at the initial stages. The current data available on heart diseases can help design better frameworks for predicting new cases. The statistics of heart disease-related death shows a worrying trend world-wide. This study concludes that a framework based on hybrid approaches consisting of the combination of classification and clustering methods of data mining, along with biological system inspired algorithms, can prove to be a landmark in the field of heart disease prediction and detection. © 2018 ACCENTS.},

As a result, Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged, which aims to measure, analyse and report students' learning behaviours using data analytics techniques. In this regard, this paper aims to provide an overview of how at-risk students are identified or predicted by analysing their learning behaviours in online learning, including the types of data and tools or analytics methods used. The findings indicate that most of the data analytics techniques have successfully identified and predicted at-risk students and various types of data are determined as attributes in predicting at-risk students. Finally, further research should be conducted to identify and predict at-risk students, since there are diverse students in online learning who have different demands, and interventions should be developed to tackle the problems faced by at-risk students in order to enhance their learning performances. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={Background Internet access and usage has changed how people seek and report health information. Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. Aim To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. Methods A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. Results 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. Conclusions The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Purpose: Enterprise social networks (ESN) are increasingly used by companies to reinforce collaboration and knowledge sharing. While prior research has investigated ESN use practices, little is known about potential user roles emerging on these platforms. Against this backdrop, this paper develops an ESN knowledge actor role framework. Design/methodology/approach: The framework is constructed based on a systematic review of literature covering knowledge worker role typologies, user roles identified in public online social spaces as well as findings from ESN research. Findings: The ESN knowledge actor role framework distinguishes eight contributing and two reading roles. It describes the associated participation behaviours and establishes metrics to identify the roles. Research limitations/implications: Providing a notion of knowledge management-related roles in ESN, the framework enables a better understanding of knowledge processes and the involved actors. Moreover, the paper advances the field of ESN data analytics by designing a set of ESN metrics to characterise user behaviour. Practical implications: Understanding ESN user roles, in particular regarding their knowledge contributions to the platform, can improve knowledge transparency in companies. The framework may usefully support the identification and management of critical knowledge resources and support decision-making in the areas of human resources management and knowledge management. Originality/value: Providing a platform for knowledge-intensive interactions as well as record of user activities, ESN are well suited to observe and identify knowledge actor roles emerging in this context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract={Anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) are sophisticated hardware and software technology solutions that can provide electronic feedback to anesthesia providers. This feedback can be tailored to provide clinical decision support (CDS) to aid clinicians with patient care processes, documentation compliance, and resource utilization. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles on near real-time and point-of-care CDS within AIMS using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. Studies were identified by searches of the electronic databases Medline and EMBASE. Two reviewers screened studies based on title, abstract, and full text. Studies that were similar in intervention and desired outcome were grouped into CDS categories. Three reviewers graded the evidence within each category. The final analysis included 25 articles on CDS as implemented within AIMS. CDS categories included perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, post-operative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, vital sign monitors and alarms, glucose management, blood pressure management, ventilator management, clinical documentation, and resource utilization. Of these categories, the reviewers graded perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and clinical documentation as having strong evidence per the peer reviewed literature. There is strong evidence for the inclusion of near real-time and point-of-care CDS in AIMS to enhance compliance with perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and clinical documentation. Additional research is needed in many other areas of AIMS-based CDS. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract={Background: “Big data” refers to large amount of dataset. Those large databases are useful in many areas, including healthcare. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) are big databases that were developed in the USA in order to record surgical outcomes. The aim of the present systematic review is to evaluate the type and clinical impact of the information retrieved through NISQP and NIS big database articles focused on laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using The Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The research was carried out on PubMed database and revealed 350 published papers. Outcomes of articles in which laparoscopic colorectal surgery was the primary aim were analyzed. Results: Fifty-five studies, published between 2007 and February 2017, were included. Articles included were categorized in groups according to the main topic as: outcomes related to surgical technique comparisons, morbidity and perioperatory results, specific disease-related outcomes, sociodemographic disparities, and academic training impact. Conclusions: NSQIP and NIS databases are just the tip of the iceberg for the potential application of Big Data technology and analysis in MIS. Information obtained through big data is useful and could be considered as external validation in those situations where a significant evidence-based medicine exists; also, those databases establish benchmarks to measure the quality of patient care. Data retrieved helps to inform decision-making and improve healthcare delivery. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios. Methods This study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model. Results Forty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75%) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25%). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26%), regression (4.91%), instance-based (11.47%), Bayesian algorithms (1.63%), reinforcement learning (4.91%), dimensionality reduction (8.19%), ensemble learning (6.55%), and decision trees (3.27%). Conclusions A classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection. New high-quality studies based on randomized controlled trials and validation of models using a large and multiple sample of data are recommended. © 2017},

  abstract={For the electronic health record (EHR) to be considered a true clinical decision support system, it must be possible to access and integrate the patients’ clinical information collected throughout their lives, guaranteeing up-to-date, safe and congruent information, immediately accessible at the place of care. Moreover, there is a considerable capacity to develop and manufacture personal health devices (PHD) highly integrated and miniaturized, which facilitate the home monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Since the information collected by PHD should be integrated in existing EHR, interoperability is an essential requirement of eHealth to allow the integration of care into a diversity of settings and care providers. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify and analyse references related to the topic of home monitoring that reveal an explicit concern with interoperability requirements. Regarding the results and considering the initial 2778 references, only 2% (61 references) explicitly mentioned interoperability issues and, within these 61 references, only eight reported end-to-end solutions that can be integrated and usable in care service provision. Therefore, the issue of interoperability of PHD, both semantic and technological, a priority for the establishment of a remote patient monitoring solution market, is discussed in this review.

  abstract={The extensive use of multimedia technologies extended the applicability of information technology to a large extent which results enormous generation of complex multimedia contents over the internet. Therefore the number of multimedia contents available to the user is also exponentially increasing. In this digital era of the cloud-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), analysis of complex video and image data plays a crucial role.It aims to extract meaningful information as the distributed storages and processing elements within a bandwidth constraint network seek optimal solutions to increase the throughput along with an optimal trade-off between computational complexity and power consumption. However, due to complex characteristics of visual patterns and variations in video frames, it is not a trivial task to discover meaningful information and correlation. Hence, data mining has emerged as a field which has diverse aspects presently in extracting meaningful hidden patterns from the complex image and video data considering different pattern classification approach. The study mostly investigates the existing data-mining tools and their performance metric for the purpose of reviewing this research track.It also highlights the relationship between frequent patterns and discriminativefeatures associated with a video object. Finally, the study addresses the existing research issues to strengthen up the future direction of research towards video analytics and pattern recognition. © Copyright 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

  abstract={This paper aims to link student facing Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) to the corpus of research on Open Learner Models (OLMs), as both have similar goals. We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling, (ii) key publication venues, (iii) authors and articles, (iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81% of papers compared with 31% for LADs), report evaluations (76% versus 59%), use assessment data (100% versus 37%), provide a comparison standard for students (52% versus 38%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33% against 75% for LADs). In OLM work, there was a heightened focus on learner control and access to their own data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract={Purpose To assess indication for examination for four breast imaging modalities and describe the complexity and heterogeneity of data sources and ascertainment methods. Methods Indication was evaluated among the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) breast cancer research centers (PRCs). Indication data were reported overall and separately for four breast imaging modalities: digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results The breast PRCs contributed 236,262 women with 607,735 breast imaging records from 31 radiology facilities. We found a high degree of heterogeneity for indication within and across six data sources. Structured codes within a data source were used most often to identify indication for mammography (59% DM, 85% DBT) and text analytics for US (45%) and MRI (44%). Indication could not be identified for 17% of US and 26% of MRI compared with 2% of mammography examinations (1% DM, 3% DBT). Conclusions Multiple and diverse data sources, heterogeneity of ascertainment methods, and nonstandardization of codes within and across data systems for determining indication were found. Consideration of data sources and standardized methodology for determining indication is needed to assure accurate measurement of cancer screening rates and performance in clinical practice and research. © 2016 American College of Radiology},

  abstract={Objectives: Hospital readmission risk prediction facilitates the identification of patients potentially at high risk so that resources can be used more efficiently in terms of cost-benefit. In this context, several models for readmission risk prediction have been proposed in recent years. The goal of this review is to give an overview of prediction models for hospital readmission, describe the data analysis methods and algorithms used for building the models, and synthesize their results. Methods: Studies that reported the predictive performance of a model for hospital readmission risk were included. We defined the scope of the review and accordingly built a search query to select the candidate papers. This query string was used as input for the chosen search engines, namely PubMed and Google Scholar. For each study, we recorded the population, feature selection method, classification algorithm, sample size, readmission threshold, readmission rate and predictive performance of the model. Results: We identified 77 studies that met the inclusion criteria, out of 265 citations. In 68% of the studies (n = 52) logistic regression or other regression techniques were utilized as the main method. Ten (13%) studies used survival analysis for model construction, while 14 (18%) used machine learning techniques for classification, of which decision tree-based methods and SVM were the most utilized algorithms. Among these, only four studies reported the use of any class imbalance addressing technique, of which resampling is the most frequent (75%). The performance of the models varied significantly among studies, with Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values in the ranges between 0.54 and 0.92. Conclusion: Logistic regression and survival analysis have been traditionally the most widely used techniques for model building. Nevertheless, machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Recent comparative studies suggest that machine learning techniques can improve prediction ability over traditional statistical approaches. Regardless, the lack of an appropriate benchmark dataset of hospital readmissions makes a comparison of models’ performance across different studies difficult. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Materials and methods A systematic literature review and in-depth exploration of factors impeding or facilitating successful implementation of guideline-based CDSS supporting physicians in clinical decision-making was performed. Factors were identified thematically by textual analysis of the included publications and were individually mapped to the human, organization and technology-fit (HOT-fit) framework for evaluating implementations of health information systems. Results A total of 421 factors were found in 35 included publications from a total of 3676 publications. The mapping of factors concerning CDSS implementation on the HOT-fit framework revealed gaps in each domain of the framework and showed that research has mainly focused on human and technology factors and less on organizational factors. Conclusions Future research within the field of guideline-based CDSS should focus on evaluating implementations through the use of socio-technical models to study guideline-based CDSS system implementations from a multidimensional view. Furthermore, research is needed to explore whether use of these models during the planning phases of a CDSS project is useful in anticipating and preventing implementation barriers from occurring and exploiting facilitators to a successful implementation of the system. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

  abstract={The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the evolutionary trends in the research domain of information technology and organizational learning. Having surveyed various journals and key conferences between 2000 and 2018 on the topic, we observe that information technology (IT) has expanded from its general form to various contemporary information systems, e.g. knowledge organization systems, communication and collaborative systems and decision support systems. However, organization learning (OL) now essentially occurs through knowledge management activities, e.g. knowledge acquisition, storing, sharing and application of knowledge. The survey reported here not only validates the interplay of IT and OL but also reveals some important intervening factors between IT and OL, e.g. absorptive capacity, organization culture, user trust, acceptance and satisfaction that work as deterministic elements in the reciprocal relationship of IT and OL. We propose future research to explore interaction between big data analytical systems and organizational learning. © 2018 authors.},

  abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted of published research articles on diagnostic test accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation published between January 2000 and May 2018 in the online article databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Paired forest plots were employed for the analysis. Numerical values for sensitivity and specificity were obtained from false negative (FN), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and true positive (TP) rates, presented alongside graphical representations with boxes marking the values and horizontal lines showing the confidence intervals (CIs). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were applied to assess the performance of diagnostic tests. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: A total of 1,879 articles were reviewed, of which 11 were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. Fve algorithms for machine learning able to predict breast cancer risk were identified: Super Vector Machine (SVM); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Decision Tree (DT); Naive Bayes (NB); and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). With the SVM, the Area Under Curve (AUC) from the SROC was > 90%, therefore classified into the excellent category. Conclusion: The meta-analysis confirmed that the SVM algorithm is able to calculate breast cancer risk with better accuracy value than other machine learning algorithms. © 2018 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.},

  abstract={There is currently an increasing effort to develop visual analytics (VA) tools that can support human analytical reasoning and decision making. In the last decade, advances in this field has allowed the application of various kinds of VA systems in real-world settings. While this represents a promising start from a product design perspective, part of the challenge to the research community is that current VA tools have evolved without due consideration of standardized design criteria and processes. Accordingly, some questions remain to be addressed on what are the useful, underlying attributes of effective VA tools and how their impact can be measured in human-product interaction. These considerations indicate a need to identify a specific range of VA tools and assess their capabilities through state-of-the-art empirical analysis. To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review of 470 VA papers published between 2006 and 2012. We report on the bibliometric techniques, the evaluation attributes and the metrics that were used to sample and analyze the body of literature. The analysis focused mainly on 26 papers that implemented visual analytics decision support tools. The results are presented in the form of six inductively derived design recommendations that, when taken together, uniquely contribute to the fields of product design and visual analytics. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={Background: There is increased research interest in the use of mobile phone apps to support diabetes management. However, there are divergent views on what constitute the minimum standards for inclusion in the development of mobile phone apps. Mobile phone apps require an evidence-based approach to development which will consequently impact on their effectiveness. Therefore, comprehensive information on developmental considerations could help designers and researchers to develop innovative and effective patient-centered self-management mobile phone apps for diabetes patients. Objective: This systematic review examined the developmental considerations adopted in trials that engaged mobile phone applications for diabetes self-management. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across 5 electronic databases; Medline, Scopus, Social Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINALHL) and supplemented by reference list from identified studies. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Critical appraisal checklist for trials. Information on developmental factors (health behavioral theory, functionality, pilot testing, user and clinical expert involvements, data privacy and app security) were assessed across experimental studies using a template developed for the review. Results: A total of 11 studies (10 randomized controlled trials and 1 quasi-experimental trial) that fitted the inclusion criteria were identified. All the included studies had the functionality of self-monitoring of blood glucose. However, only some of them included functions for data analytics (7/11, 63.6%), education (6/11, 54.5%) and reminder (6/11, 54.5%). There were 5/11(45.5%) studies with significantly improved glycosylated hemoglobin in the intervention groups where educational functionality was present in the apps used in the 5 trials. Only 1 (1/11, 9.1%) study considered health behavioral theory and user involvement, while 2 (2/11, 18.1%) other studies reported the involvement of clinical experts in the development of their apps. There were 4 (4/11, 36.4%) studies which referred to data security and privacy considerations during their app development while 7 (7/12, 63.6%) studies provided information on pilot testing of apps before use in the full trial. Overall, none of the studies provided information on all developmental factors assessed in the review. Conclusions: There is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the development of apps used as interventions for diabetes self-management. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of practical and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients. © Mary D Adu, Usman H Malabu, Emily J Callander, Aduli E O Malau-Aduli, Bunmi S Malau-Aduli.},

  abstract={Big data has been considered to be a breakthrough technological development over recent years. Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model. © 2017 The Authors},

  abstract={Prolongation of the heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) interval increases the risk for torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially fatal arrhythmia. The likelihood of TdP is higher in patients with risk factors that include female sex, older age, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, concomitant administration of two or more QTc interval-prolonging medications, among others. Assessment and quantification of risk factors may facilitate prediction of patients at highest risk for developing QTc interval prolongation and TdP. Investigators have utilized the field of predictive analytics, which generates predictions using techniques including data mining, modeling, machine learning, and others, to develop methods of risk quantification and prediction of QTc interval prolongation. Predictive analytics have also been incorporated into clinical decision support (CDS) tools to alert clinicians regarding patients at increased risk of developing QTc interval prolongation. The objectives of this article are to assess the effectiveness of predictive analytics for identification of patients at risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and to discuss the efficacy of incorporation of predictive analytics into CDS tools in clinical practice. A systematic review of English-language articles (human subjects only) was performed, yielding 57 articles, with an additional 4 articles identified from other sources; a total of 10 articles were included in this review. Risk scores for QTc interval prolongation have been developed in various patient populations including those in cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) and in broader populations of hospitalized or health system patients. One group developed a risk score that includes information regarding genetic polymorphisms; this score significantly predicted TdP. Development of QTc interval prolongation risk prediction models and incorporation of these models into CDS tools reduce the risk of QTc interval prolongation in cardiac ICUs and identify health system patients at increased risk for mortality. The impact of these QTc interval prolongation predictive analytics on overall patient safety outcomes, such as TdP and sudden cardiac death relative to the cost of development and implementation, requires further study. © 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},

In this chapter, a classification of data mining applications in clinical decision making is presented through a systematic review. The applications of data mining techniques in clinical decision making are divided into two main categories: diagnosis and treatment. Early prediction of medical conditions, detecting multi-morbidity and complications of diseases, identifying and predicting the chronic diseases and medical imaging are the subcategories which are defined in the diagnosis part. The Treatment category is composed of treatment effectiveness and predicting the average length of stay in hospital. The majority of the reviewed articles are related to diagnosis and there is only one article which discusses the determination of drug dosage in successful treatment.

  abstract={Background Big data and cutting-edge analytic methods in nursing research challenge nurse scientists to extend the data sources and analytic methods used for discovering and translating knowledge. Purpose The purpose of this study was to identify, analyze, and synthesize exemplars of big data nursing research applied to practice and disseminated in key nursing informatics, general biomedical informatics, and nursing research journals. Methods A literature review of studies published between 2009 and 2015. There were 650 journal articles identified in 17 key nursing informatics, general biomedical informatics, and nursing research journals in the Web of Science database. After screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies published in 18 articles were identified as big data nursing research applied to practice. Discussion Nurses clearly are beginning to conduct big data research applied to practice. These studies represent multiple data sources and settings. Although numerous analytic methods were used, the fundamental issue remains to define the types of analyses consistent with big data analytic methods. Conclusion There are needs to increase the visibility of big data and data science research conducted by nurse scientists, further examine the use of state of the science in data analytics, and continue to expand the availability and use of a variety of scientific, governmental, and industry data resources. A major implication of this literature review is whether nursing faculty and preparation of future scientists (PhD programs) are prepared for big data and data science. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence that allows computer algorithms to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. OBJECTIVE: To summarize neurosurgical applications of ML where it has been compared to clinical expertise, here referred to as “natural intelligence.” METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases as of August 2016 to review all studies comparing the performance of various ML approaches with that of clinical experts in neurosurgical literature. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were identified that used ML algorithms for diagnosis, presurgical planning, or outcome prediction in neurosurgical patients. Compared to clinical experts, ML models demonstrated a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 13% (interquartile range 4-21%) and 0.14 (interquartile range 0.07-0.21), respectively. In 29 (58%) of the 50 outcome measures for which a P-value was provided or calculated, ML models outperformed clinical experts (P < .05). In 18 of 50 (36%), no difference was seen between ML and expert performance (P > .05), while in 3 of 50 (6%) clinical experts outperformed ML models (P < .05). All 4 studies that compared clinicians assisted by ML models vs clinicians alone demonstrated a better performance in the first group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ML models have the potential to augment the decision-making capacity of clinicians in neurosurgical applications; however, significant hurdles remain associated with creating, validating, and deploying ML models in the clinical setting. Shifting from the preconceptions of a human-vs-machine to a human-and-machine paradigm could be essential to overcome these hurdles. © 2017 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

A physician-driven review was conducted to assess extent of patient outcome effects of recently published CDSS studies. To facilitate future reimplementations within existing hospital information systems, input variables of included systems were extracted, standardized and annotated with semantic codes. Item category coverages of the different systems were then compared. 73% of studies showed positive medical effect. Of these, 53% showed strong positive medical effect by reducing incidence of deep vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms. Outcomeimproving systems tend to cover more item categories. A broad set of clinically relevant input variables should be taken into account or reused from the electronic health record if considering CDSS implementation.

  abstract={Objective To review the current state of science using big data to advance Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and practice. In particular, we analyzed the types of research foci addressed, corresponding methods employed and study findings reported using big data in AD. Method Systematic review was conducted for articles published in PubMed from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015. Keywords with AD and big data analytics were used for literature retrieval. Articles were reviewed and included if they met the eligibility criteria. Results Thirty-eight articles were included in this review. They can be categorized into seven research foci: diagnosing AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 10), predicting MCI to AD conversion (n = 13), stratifying risks for AD (n = 5), mining the literature for knowledge discovery (n = 4), predicting AD progression (n = 2), describing clinical care for persons with AD (n = 3), and understanding the relationship between cognition and AD (n = 3). The most commonly used datasets are AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 16), electronic health records (EHR) (n = 11), MEDLINE (n = 3), and other research datasets (n = 8). Logistic regression (n = 9) and support vector machine (n = 8) are the most used methods for data analysis. Conclusion Big data are increasingly used to address AD-related research questions.

  abstract={Background: Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of non-communicable deaths worldwide. Its diagnosis is a highly complex task, for which modelling through automated methods has been attempted. A systematic review of the literature was performed on diagnostic tests that applied intelligent systems tools in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Methods: A systematic review of the literature is presented using Medline, Embase, Scopus, IEEE/IET Electronic Library, ISI Web of Science, Latindex and LILACS databases for articles that include the diagnostic evaluation of acute coronary syndromes using intelligent systems. The review process was conducted independently by 2 reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through the participation of a third person. The operational characteristics of the studied tools were extracted. Results: A total of 35 references met the inclusion criteria. In 22 (62.8%) cases, neural networks were used. In five studies, the performances of several intelligent systems tools were compared. Thirteen studies sought to perform diagnoses of all acute coronary syndromes, and in 22, only infarctions were studied. In 21 cases, clinical and electrocardiographic aspects were used as input data, and in 10, only electrocardiographic data were used. Most intelligent systems use the clinical context as a reference standard. High rates of diagnostic accuracy were found with better performance using neural networks and support vector machines, compared with statistical tools of pattern recognition and decision trees. Conclusions: Extensive evidence was found that shows that using intelligent systems tools achieves a greater degree of accuracy than some clinical algorithms or scales and, thus, should be considered appropriate tools for supporting diagnostic decisions of acute coronary syndromes. © 2017 Instituto Nacional de Cardiología Ignacio Chávez.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from large complex datasets without being explicitly programmed. Although ML is already widely manifest in our daily lives in various forms, the considerable potential of ML has yet to find its way into mainstream medical research and day-to-day clinical care. The complex diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used in neurosurgery provide a vast amount of data that is ideally suited for ML models. This systematic review explores ML’s potential to assist and improve neurosurgical care. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases to identify all potentially relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. All studies were included that evaluated ML models assisting neurosurgical treatment. Results: Of the 6,402 citations identified, 221 studies were selected after subsequent title/abstract and full-text screening. In these studies, ML was used to assist surgical treatment of patients with epilepsy, brain tumors, spinal lesions, neurovascular pathology, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Across multiple paradigms, ML was found to be a valuable tool for presurgical planning, intraoperative guidance, neurophysiological monitoring, and neurosurgical outcome prediction. Conclusions: ML has started to find applications aimed at improving neurosurgical care by increasing the efficiency and precision of perioperative decision-making. A thorough validation of specific ML models is essential before implementation in clinical neurosurgical care. To bridge the gap between research and clinical care, practical and ethical issues should be considered parallel to the development of these techniques. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms have been associated with IHD risk, but the findings presented with heterogeneity. The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to provide an updated evaluation by integrating machine-learning based analytics to examine the potential source of heterogeneity on the associations between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risk of various subtypes of IHD, as well as the possible impact of air pollution on MTHFR polymorphisms and IHD risks. A comprehensive search of various databases was conducted to locate 123 studies (29,697 cases and 31,028 controls) for MTHFR C677T, and 18 studies (7158 cases and 5482 controls) for MTHFR A1298C. Overall, MTHFR 677 polymorphisms were risks for IHD (TT: Risk ratio (RR) = 1.23, p < 0.0001; CT: RR = 1.04, p = 0.0028, and TT plus CT: RR = 1.09, p < 0.0001). In contrast, MTHFR 677 CC wildtype was protective against IHD (RR = 0.91, p < 0.00001) for overall populations. Three countries with elevated IHD risks from MTHFR C677T polymorphism with RR >2 included India, Turkey, and Tunisia. Meta-predictive analysis revealed that increased air pollution was associated with increased MTHFR 677 TT and CT polymorphisms in both the case and control group (p < 0.05), with the trend of increased IHD risk resulting from increased air pollution. These results associate the potential inflammatory pathway with air pollution and the folate pathway with MTHFR polymorphism. Future intervention studies can be designed to mitigate MTHFR enzyme deficiencies resulting from gene polymorphisms to prevent IHDs for at-risk populations. © 2018 by the authors.

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of research on learning dashboards in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The initial search of five main academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out of which 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as various aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that systematically compare different dashboard designs. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={Health analytics is a business-driven term that encompasses a wide spectrum of aspects and dimensions of business intelligence applications and big data analysis. Healthcare organizations recently are eager to know whether they are getting the full value from the massive amounts of data and information they already have, to achieve their strategic effectiveness goals and operational efficiency objectives. It is very crucial to learn more about the diverse functions, types and levels through which health analytics can support such tasks. A careful review of literature was conducted, and a qualitative analysis was used to classify health analytics. Five main types of analytics could be identified; these are descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive and discovery analytics, each has its own distinct role in improving healthcare. In addition to the five types, health analytics could also be classified into three levels of performance and engagement, these are the operational, tactical and strategic health analytics. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

  abstract={In this era of information technology, there is a huge and excessive amount of fully distributed, structured and unstructured data which is usually referred as 'Big Data'. This data cannot be easily and directly used for business purposes due to its excessiveness nature. Therefore, it is required to intelligently process this large amount of data to extract desired information and examine pattern to make decisions and predictions for certain business objectives. In this context, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques are frequently applied for Big Data analytics. This paper investigates the latest models, approaches and tools for Big Data analytics using model driven approaches. Particularly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to select and analyze 24 researches published during 2010 to 2017. This leads to identify 18 models, 13 tools, and 10 approaches for big data analytics using model driven approaches. The findings of this SLR are highly valuable for the researchers, students and practitioners of the domain. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract={Evidence-based medicine is the most prevalent paradigm adopted by physicians. Clinical practice guidelines typically define a set of recommendations together with eligibility criteria that restrict their applicability to a specific group of patients. The ever-growing size and availability of health-related data is currently challenging the broad definitions of guideline-defined patient groups. Precision medicine leverages on genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics to provide precise identification of patient subsets for treatment targeting. Defining a patient similarity measure is thus an essential step to allow stratification of patients into clinically-meaningful subgroups. The present review investigates the use of patient similarity as a tool to enable precision medicine. 279 articles were analyzed along four dimensions: data types considered, clinical domains of application, data analysis methods, and translational stage of findings. Cancer-related research employing molecular profiling and standard data analysis techniques such as clustering constitute the majority of the retrieved studies. Chronic and psychiatric diseases follow as the second most represented clinical domains. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the studies analyzed presented a novel methodology, with the most advanced employing data integration strategies and being portable to different clinical domains. Integration of such techniques into decision support systems constitutes and interesting trend for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze existing approaches, audiences, purposes, contexts, and data sources—both individually and in relation to one another—that designers and researchers have used to visualize educational data. Second, we examine how established literature in the fields of information visualization and education has been used to inform the design of visual learning analytics tools and to discuss research findings. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories.

  abstract={Introduction: Disproportionality analysis (DA) of adverse drug reactions spontaneous reporting (SR) databases is used to identify signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR). The objective of this study was to identify the generation of SDR in the published literature and whether it led to regulatory action. Methods: A systematic literature search in MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in a 10-year period, from 2005 to 2014, was conducted, to identify studies designed to detect drug safety signals through the use of disproportionality measures applied to spontaneous reporting databases of adverse drug reactions. Results: Seventy three studies were included. The number of publications has been rising over the study time period. Forty nine studies focus on drug-event combinations. Large international and smaller national or regional databases were identified. The disproportionality measures applied included frequentist and Bayesian methods and some studies used more than one method. SDRs were identified in more than ninety percent of the studies. Ten studies were found to be confirmatory of previous regulatory decision. Conclusion: It was not found any safety signal issued by drug regulatory agencies exclusively generated by DA. More research devoted to this issue is needed, since the value of these methods on drug safety signaling and their impact on drug regulation actions remains to be established. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

  abstract={Background: Automatic identification of gene and protein names from biomedical publications can help curators and researchers to keep up with the findings published in the scientific literature. As of today, this is a challenging task related to information retrieval, and in the realm of Big Data Analytics. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of using word embeddings (i.e. distributed word representations) from Deep Learning algorithms together with terms from the Cardiovascular Disease Ontology (CVDO) as a step to identifying omics information encoded in the biomedical literature. Methods: Word embeddings were generated using the neural language models CBOW and Skip-gram with an input of more than 14 million PubMed citations (titles and abstracts) corresponding to articles published between 2000 and 2016. Then the abstracts of selected papers from the sysVASC systematic review were manually annotated with gene/protein names. We set up two experiments that used the word embeddings to produce term variants for gene/protein names: the first experiment used the terms manually annotated from the papers; the second experiment enriched/expanded the annotated terms using terms from the human-readable labels of key classes (gene/proteins) from the CVDO ontology. CVDO is formalised in the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) and contains 172,121 UniProt Knowledgebase protein classes related to human and 86,792 UniProtKB protein classes related to mouse. The hypothesis is that by enriching the original annotated terms, a better context is provided, and therefore, it is easier to obtain suitable (full and/or partial) term variants for gene/protein names from word embeddings. Results: From the papers manually annotated, a list of 107 terms (gene/protein names) was acquired. As part of the word embeddings generated from CBOW and Skip-gram, a lexicon with more than 9 million terms was created. Using the cosine similarity metric, a list of the 12 top-ranked terms was generated from word embeddings for query terms present in the generated lexicon. Domain experts evaluated a total of 1968 pairs of terms and classified the retrieved terms as: TV (term variant); PTV (partial term variant); and NTV (non term variant, meaning none of the previous two categories). In experiment I, Skip-gram finds the double amount of (full and/or partial) term variants for gene/protein names as compared with CBOW. Using Skip-gram, the weighted Cohen's Kappa inter-annotator agreement for two domain experts was 0.80 for the first experiment and 0.74 for the second experiment. In the first experiment, suitable (full and/or partial) term variants were found for 65 of the 107 terms. In the second experiment, the number increased to 100. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the benefits of using terms from the CVDO ontology classes to obtain more pertinent term variants for gene/protein names from word embeddings generated from an unannotated corpus with more than 14 million PubMed citations. As the terms variants are induced from the biomedical literature, they can facilitate data tagging and semantic indexing tasks. Overall, our study explores the feasibility of obtaining methods that scale when dealing with big data, and which enable automation of deep semantic analysis and markup of textual information from unannotated biomedical literature.},

  abstract={Background: A gap between current diabetes care practice and recommended diabetes care standards has consistently been reported in the literature. Many IT-based interventions have been developed to improve adherence to the quality of care standards for chronic illness like diabetes. Objective: The widespread implementation of electronic medical/health records has catalyzed clinical decision support systems (CDSS) which may improve the quality of diabetes care. Therefore, the objective of the review is to evaluate the effectiveness of CDSS in improving quality of type II diabetes care. Moreover, the review aims to highlight the key indicators of quality improvement to assist policy makers in development of future diabetes care policies through the integration of information technology and system. Selection of study: Setting inclusion criteria, a systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Web of Science and Science Direct. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools were used to evaluate the quality of studies. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for the review. In the selected studies, seventeen clinical markers of diabetes care were discussed. Three quality of care indicators were given more importance in monitoring the progress of diabetes care, which is consistent with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The presence of these indicators in the studies helped to determine which studies were selected for review. Clinical- and process-related improvements are compared between intervention group using CDSS and control group with usual care. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure (BP) were the quality of care indicators studied at the levels of process of care and clinical outcome. Findings: The review has found both inconsistent and variable results for quality of diabetes care measures. A significant improvement has been found in the process of care for all three measures of quality of diabetes care. However, weak to modest positive results are observed for the clinical measures of the diabetes care indicators. In addition to this, technology adoption of CDSS is found to be consistently low. Conclusion: The review suggests the need to conduct further empirical research using the critical diabetes care indicators (HbA1c, LDL-C and BP) to ascertain if CDSS improves the quality of diabetes care. Research designs should be improved, especially with regard to baseline characteristics, sample size and study period. With respect to implementation of CDSS, rather than a sudden change of clinical work practice, there should instead be an incremental, gradual adoption of technology that minimizes the disruption in clinical workflow. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Objective: This paper shall first investigate the informatics areas and applications of the four Traditional Medicine systems - Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine and Traditional Malay Medicine. Then, this paper shall examine the national informatics infrastructure initiatives in the four respective countries that support the Traditional Medicine systems. Challenges of implementing informatics in Traditional Medicine Systems shall also be discussed. Methods: The literature was sourced from four databases: Ebsco Host, IEEE Explore, Proquest and Google scholar. The search term used was "Traditional Medicine", "informatics", "informatics infrastructure", "traditional Chinese medicine", "Ayurveda", "traditional Arabic and Islamic medicine", and "traditional malay medicine". A combination of the search terms above was also executed to enhance the searching process. A search was also conducted in Google to identify miscellaneous books, publications, and organization websites using the same terms. Results: Amongst major advancements in TCM and Ayurveda are bioinformatics, development of Traditional Medicine databases for decision system support, data mining and image processing. Traditional Chinese Medicine differentiates itself from other Traditional Medicine systems with documented ISO Standards to support the standardization of TCM. Informatics applications in Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine are mostly ehealth applications that focus more on spiritual healing, Islamic obligations and prophetic traditions. Literature regarding development of health informatics to support Traditional Malay Medicine is still insufficient. Major informatics infrastructure that is common in China and India are automated insurance payment systems for Traditional Medicine treatment. National informatics infrastructure in Middle East and Malaysia mainly cater for modern medicine. Other infrastructure such as telemedicine and hospital information systems focus its implementation in modern medicine or are not implemented and strategized at a national level to support Traditional Medicine. Conclusion: Informatics may not be able to address all the emerging areas of Traditional Medicine because the concepts in Traditional Medicine system of medicine are different from modern system, though the aim may be same, i.e., to give relief to the patient. Thus, there is a need to synthesize Traditional Medicine systems and informatics with involvements from modern system of medicine. Future research works may include filling the gaps of informatics areas and integrate national informatics infrastructure with established Traditional Medicine systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Many organizations identified the opportunities of big data analytics to support the business with problem-specific insights through the exploitation of generated data. Socio-technical solutions are developed in big data projects to reach competitive advantage. Although these projects are aligned to specific business needs, common architectural challenges are not addressed in a comprehensive manner. Enterprise architecture management is a holistic approach to tackle the complex business and IT architecture. The transformation of an organization's EA is influenced by big data projects and their data-driven approach on all layers. To enable strategy-oriented development of the EA it is essential to synchronize these projects supported by EA management. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of big data literature to analyze which requirements for the EA management discipline are proposed. Thereby, a broad overview about existing research is presented to facilitate a more detailed exploration and to foster the evolution of the EA management discipline. © 2016 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

  abstract={Evaluating DSS involves examining multi-dimensional attributes associated with the value of DSS though the analysis of costs and benefits, changes in the decision process, and the quality of decision support systems. In the early 1990s, DeLone and McLean presented the IS success model as a framework and model for conceptualizing and operationalizing IS (including DSS) success. The DM model is one of the widely recognized IS models based on a systematic review of 180 studies which investigated over 100 success measures. An important assumption of the DM model is that it is the model to explain IS success in a voluntary IS use context. Due to the voluntariness of IS use, the 'use' of the system is in the center of the model. This paper empirically tests the validity of the DM model in an e-learning environment and found out that the DM model failed to support the positive relationships between system use and system outcome. Can the DM model of IS success be applied to evaluate the DSS success? The answer may be probably no. The future research is needed to construct a comprehensive model for evaluating DSS success. The 'use' may no longer be a critical construct in evaluating DSS success in that a substantial portion of DSS published seem to be mandatory or semi-mandatory. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.},

  abstract={Introduction: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complex disease with multiple aetiological factors, wide ranging severity, and multiple challenges to effective triage and management. Databases, data mining and machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including artificial neural networks (ANNs), may assist by storing and interpreting data from multiple sources, potentially improving clinical decision-making. Aims: 1) Identify database technologies used to store AP data, 2) collate and categorise variables stored in AP databases, 3) identify the MLA technologies, including ANNs, used to analyse AP data, and 4) identify clinical and non-clinical benefits and obstacles in establishing a national or international AP database. Methods: Comprehensive systematic search of online reference databases. The predetermined inclusion criteria were all papers discussing 1) databases, 2) data mining or 3) MLAs, pertaining to AP, independently assessed by two reviewers with conflicts resolved by a third author. Results: Forty-three papers were included. Three data mining technologies and five ANN methodologies were reported in the literature. There were 187 collected variables identified. ANNs increase accuracy of severity prediction, one study showed ANNs had a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.96 six hours after admission e compare APACHE II (cutoff score 8) with 0.80 and 0.85 respectively. Problems with databases were incomplete data, lack of clinical data, diagnostic reliability and missing clinical data. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review examining the use of databases, MLAs and ANNs in the management of AP. The clinical benefits these technologies have over current systems and other advantages to adopting them are identified. Copyright © 2013, IAP and EPC.

  abstract={Background: Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease affecting 9.6 % of American children. Delay in asthma diagnosis is prevalent, resulting in suboptimal asthma management. To help avoid delay in asthma diagnosis and advance asthma prevention research, researchers have proposed various models to predict asthma development in children. This paper reviews these models. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through searching in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and OpenGrey up to June 3, 2015. The literature on predictive models for asthma development in children was retrieved, with search results limited to human subjects and children (birth to 18 years). Two independent reviewers screened the literature, performed data extraction, and assessed article quality. Results: The literature search returned 13,101 references in total. After manual review, 32 of these references were determined to be relevant and are discussed in the paper. We identify several limitations of existing predictive models for asthma development in children, and provide preliminary thoughts on how to address these limitations. Conclusions: Existing predictive models for asthma development in children have inadequate accuracy. Efforts to improve these models' performance are needed, but are limited by a lack of a gold standard for asthma development in children. © 2015 Luo et al.},

  abstract={Objectives: (i) To review contributions and limitations of decision support systems for automatic recruitment of patients to clinical trials (Clinical Trial Recruitment Support Systems, CTRSS). (ii) To characterize the important features of this domain, the main classes of approach that have been used, and their advantages and disadvantages. (iii) To assess the effectiveness and potential of such systems in improving trial recruitment rates. Data sources:: A systematic MESH keyword-based search of Pubmed, Embase, and Scholar Google for relevant CTRSS publications from January 1st 1998 to August 31st 2009 yielded 73 references, from which 33 relevant papers describing 28 distinct studies were chosen for review, based on their report of a novel decision support system for trial recruitment which reused already available patient data. Method: The reviewed papers were classified using a modified version of an existing taxonomy for clinical decision support systems, using 10 axes relevant to the trial recruitment domain. Results: It proved possible and useful to characterize CTRSS on a relatively small number of dimensions and a number of clear trends emerge from the study. Only nine papers reported a useful evaluation of the effectiveness of the system in terms of trial pre-inclusion or enrolment rate. While all the systems reviewed re-use structured and coded patient data none attempts the more difficult task of using unstructured patient notes to pre-screen for trial inclusion. Few studies address acceptance of systems by clinicians, or integration into clinical workflow, and there is little evidence of use of interoperability standards. Conclusions: System design, scope, and assessment methodology vary significantly between papers, making it difficult to establish the impact of different approaches on recruitment rate. It is clear, however, that the pre-screening phase of trial recruitment is the most effective part of the process to address with CTRSS, that clinical workflow integration and clinician acceptance are critical for this class of decision support, and that the current trends in this field are towards generalization and scalability. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Background: Recent advances in information technology (IT) coupled with the increased ubiquitous nature of information technology (IT) present unique opportunities for improving diabetes self-management. The objective of this paper is to determine, in a systematic review, how IT has been used to improve self-management for adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Methods: The review covers articles extracted from relevant databases using search terms related information technology and diabetes self-management published after 1970 until August 2012. Additional articles were extracted using the citation map in Web of Science. Articles representing original research describing the use of IT as an enabler for self-management tasks performed by the patient are included in the final analysis. Results: Overall, 74% of studies showed some form of added benefit, 13% articles showed no-significant value provided by IT, and 13% of articles did not clearly define the added benefit due to IT. Information technologies used included the Internet (47%), cellular phones (32%), telemedicine (12%), and decision support techniques (9%). Limitations and research gaps identified include usability, real-time feedback, integration with provider electronic medical record (EMR), as well as analytics and decision support capabilities. Conclusion: There is a distinct need for more comprehensive interventions, in which several technologies are integrated in order to be able to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. Such IT interventions should be theoretically founded and should rely on principles of user-centered and socio-technical design in its planning, design and implementation. Moreover, the effectiveness of self-management systems should be assessed along multiple dimensions: motivation for self-management, long-term adherence, cost, adoption, satisfaction and outcomes as a final result. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Evaluation of DSS is concerned with analyzing costs and benefits of DSS before and after DSS development and implementation. The unique nature of DSS evaluation is that although some DSS provide substantial cost savings and profit increases, measurements of benefits of DSS have been problematic as quantification of the positive impacts of the improved decision process is difficult. In the early 1990s, DeLone and McLean presented the information systems (IS) success model as a framework and model for conceptualizing and operationalizing IS (including DSS) success. The DM model is one of the widely recognized IS models based on a systematic review of 180 studies which investigated over 100 success measures. An important assumption of the DM model is that it is the model to explain IS success in a voluntary IS use context. Due to the results of many empirical research results which do not support the positive relationship between system use and other constructs, Seddon presents a respecified and extended version of DeLone and McLean’s model. We empirically tested the respecified version of the DM IS success model in an e-learning context, which is a strictly involuntary use setting. The paper provides an empirical evidence to support an alternative DSS evaluation model that can replace “system use” as the pivotal element of IS success model, with “perceived usefulness”. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

  abstract={Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is one of the most suitable AI techniques for building clinical decision support systems. Medical domain complexity introduces many challenges for building these systems. Building the systems' knowledge base from the Electronic Health Record (EHR), the encoding of case-base knowledge with standard medical ontology, and the handling of vague data are examples of these challenges. Although several advantages of using CBR in medicine have been identified, there are no real systems acceptable to physicians. This systematic review examines the current state of CBR and its limitations in the medical domain, especially for diabetes mellitus. The critical evaluation of the status of diabetes CBR systems presents unique opportunities for improving these systems. The literature review covers most of the English language studies extracted from relevant databases by using search terms relating CBR, ontology, Fuzzy, and standard terminology concepts. The authors identify 38 articles published between 1999 and 15 January 2015, which represent original researches in CBR domain. The study includes 15 (39.5%) non-medical studies and 23 (60.5%) medical studies with 22% for diabetes CBR. A list of 18 integrated evaluation metrics has been proposed and used in the analysis. The results show that the non-medical CBR systems achieved higher advances (50%) than medical systems (42.9%). In addition, the diabetes management CBR systems achieve the lowest advances (21.4%) compared to other systems. These shortages explain the question "why CBR paradigm are not fully utilized in the commercial medical systems?" As a result, there is a distinct need for more comprehensive enhancements in clinical CBR especially diabetes systems. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.},

  abstract={Serious game analytics share many of the challenges of data analytics for computer systems involving human activity. Key challenges include how to collect data without influencing its generation, and more fundamentally, how to collect and validate data from humans where a primary emphasis is on what people are thinking and doing. This chapter presents a meta-analysis of data collection activities in serious games research. A systematic review was conducted to consider metrics and measures across the human-computer interaction, gaming, simulation, and virtual reality literature. The review focus was on the temporal aspect of data collection to identify if data is collected before, during, or after gameplay and if so what fundamental processes are used to collect data. The review found that the majority of data collection occurred post-game, then pre-game, and finally during gameplay. This reflects traditional difficulties of capturing gameplay data and highlights opportunities for new data capture approaches oriented towards data analytics. Also we identify how researchers gather data to answer fundamental questions about the efficacy of serious games and the design elements that might underlie their efficacy. We suggest that more standardized and better-validated data collection techniques, that allow comparing and contrasting outcomes between studies, would be beneficial. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract={Background: Patient medical records contain many entries relating to patient conditions, treatments and lab results. Generally involve multiple types of data and produces a large amount of information. These databases can provide important information for clinical decision and to support the management of the hospital. Medical databases have some specificities not often found in others non-medical databases. In this context, outlier detection techniques can be used to detect abnormal patterns in health records (for instance, problems in data quality) and this contributing to better data and better knowledge in the process of decision making. Aim: This systematic review intention to provide a better comprehension about the techniques used to detect outliers in healthcare data, for creates automatisms for those methods in the order to facilitate the access to information with quality in healthcare. Methods: The literature was systematically reviewed to identify articles mentioning outlier detection techniques or anomalies in medical data. Four distinct bibliographic databases were searched: Medline, ISI, IEEE and EBSCO. Results: From 4071 distinct papers selected, 80 were included after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the medical specialty 32% of the techniques are intended for oncology and 37% of them using patient data. Considering only articles that used administrative medical data, 59% of the techniques were statistical based. Conclusion: The area with outliers detection techniques most widely used in medical administrative data is the statistics, when compared with techniques from data mining such as clustering and nearest neighbor.},

  abstract={Objective: Describe optimal design attributes of clinical decision support (CDS) interventions for medication prescribing, emphasizing perceptual, cognitive and functional characteristics that improve human-computer interaction (HCI) and patient safety. Methods: Findings from published reports on success, failures and lessons learned during implementation of CDS systems were reviewed and interpreted with regard to HCI and software usability principles. We then formulated design recommendations for CDS alerts that would reduce unnecessary workflow interruptions and allow clinicians to make informed decisions quickly, accurately and without extraneous cognitive and interactive effort. Results: Excessive alerting that tends to distract clinicians rather than provide effective CDS can be reduced by designing only high severity alerts as interruptive dialog boxes and less severe warnings without explicit response requirement, by curating system knowledge bases to suppress warnings with low clinical utility and by integrating contextual patient data into the decision logic. Recommended design principles include parsimonious and consistent use of color and language, minimalist approach to the layout of information and controls, the use of font attributes to convey hierarchy and visual prominence of important data over supporting information, the inclusion of relevant patient data in the context of the alert and allowing clinicians to respond with one or two clicks. Conclusion: Although HCI and usability principles are well established and robust, CDS and EHR system interfaces rarely conform to the best known design conventions and are seldom conceived and designed well enough to be truly versatile and dependable tools. These relatively novel interventions still require careful monitoring, research and analysis of its track record to mature. Clarity and specificity of alert content and optimal perceptual and cognitive attributes, for example, are essential for providing effective decision support to clinicians. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Millions of people around the world suffer from pain, acute or chronic and this raises the importance of its screening, assessment and treatment. Pain, is highly subjective and the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play an important part in improving the accuracy of pain assessment, and lead to better clinical practices. This review examines CDSSs, in relation to computer technologies and was conducted with the following electronic databases: CiteSeerx, IEEE Xplore, ISI Web of Knowledge, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, PubMed, Science Accelerator, Science.gov, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and The Cochrane Library. The studies referenced were compiled with several criteria in mind. Firstly, that they constituted a decision support system. Secondly, that study data included pain values or results based on the detection of pain. Thirdly, that they were published in English, between 1992 and 2011, and finally that they focused on patients with acute or chronic pain. In total, thirty-nine studies highlighted the following topics: rule based algorithms, artificial neural networks, rough and fuzzy sets, statistical learning algorithms, terminologies, questionnaires and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%. The lack of integration with mobile devices, the limited use of web-based interfaces and the scarcity of systems that allow for data to be inserted by patients were all limitations that were detected. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.},

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) aim to benefit the clinical decision making process.

  abstract={Intelligent agents and healthcare have been intimately linked in the last years. The intrinsic complexity and diversity of care can be tackled with the flexibility, dynamics and reliability of multi-agent systems. The purpose of this review is to show the feasibility of applying intelligent agents in the healthcare domain and use the findings to provide a discussion of current trends and devise future research directions. A review of the most recent literature (2009–2014) of applications of agents in healthcare is discussed, and two classifications considering the main goal of the health systems as well as the main actors involved have been investigated. This review shows that the number of published works exhibits a growing interest of researchers in this field in a wide range of applications. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={Objectives: To review for acute abdominal pain (AAP), the diagnostic accuracies of combining decision tools (DTs) and doctors aided by DTs compared with those of unaided doctors. Also to evaluate the impact of providing doctors with an AAP DT on patient outcomes, clinical decisions and actions, what factors are likely to determine the usage rates and usability of a DT and the associated costs and likely cost-effectiveness of these DTs in routine use in the UK. Design: Electronic databases were searched up to 1 July 2003. Review methods: Data from each eligible study were extracted. Potential sources of heterogeneity were extracted for both questions. For the accuracy review, meta-analysis was conducted. Among studies comparing diagnostic accuracies of DTs with unaided doctors, error rate ratios provided estimates of the differences between the false-negative and false-positive rates of the DT and unaided doctors' performance. Pooled error rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for false-negative rates and false-positive rates were computed. Metaregression was used to explore heterogeneity. Results: Thirty-two studies from 27 articles, all based in secondary care, were eligible for the review of DT accuracies, while two were eligible for the review of the accuracy of hospital doctors aided by DTs. Sensitivities and specificities for DTs ranged from 53 to 99% and from 30 to 99%, respectively. Those for unaided doctors ranged from 64 to 93% and from 39 to 91%, respectively. Thirteen studies reported false-positive and false-negative rates for both DTs and unaided doctors, enabling a direct comparison of their performance. In random effects meta-analyses, DTs had significantly lower false-positive rates (error rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83) than unaided doctors. DTs may have higher false-negative rates than unaided doctors (error rate ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.93). Significant heterogeneity was present. Two studies compared the diagnostic accuracies of doctors aided by DTs to unaided doctors. In a multiarm cluster randomised controlled trial (n = 5193), the diagnostic accuracy of doctors not given access to DTs was not significantly worse (sensitivity 28.4% and specificity 96.0%) than that of three groups of aided doctors (sensitivities of 42.4-47.9%, and specificities of 95.5-96.5%, respectively). In an uncontrolled before-and-after study (n = 1484), the sensitivities and specificities of aided and unaided doctors were 95.5% and 91.5% (p = 0.24) and 78.1% and 86.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. The metaregression of DTs showed that prospective test-set validation at the site of the tool's development was associated with considerably higher diagnostic accuracy than prospective test-set validation at an independent centre [relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) 8.2; 95% CI 3.1 to 14.7]. It also showed that the earlier in the year the study was performed the higher the performance (RDOR 0.88, 0.83 to 0.92), that when developers evaluated their own DT there was better performance than when independent evaluators carried out the study (RDOR = 3.0, 1.3 to 6.8), and that there was no evidence of association between other quality indicators and DT accuracy. The one eligible study of the impact study review, a four-arm cluster randomised trial (n = 5193), showed that hospital admission rates of patients by doctors not allocated to a DT (42.8%) were significantly higher than those by doctors allocated to three combinations of decision support (34.2-38.5%) (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a difference between perforation rates (p = 0.19) and negative laparotomy rates in the four trial arms (p = 0.46). Usage rates of DTs by doctors in accident and emergency departments ranged from 10 to 77% in the six studies that reported them. Possible determinants of usability include the reasoning method used, the number of items used and the output format. A deterministic cost-effectiveness comparison demonstrated that a paper checklist is likely to be 100-900 times more cost-effective than a computer-based DT under stated assumptions. Conclusions: With their significantly greater specificity and lower false-positive rates than doctors, DTs are potentially useful in confirming a diagnosis of acute appendicitis, but not in ruling it out. The clinical use of well-designed, condition-specific paper or computer-based structured checklists is promising as a way to improve impact on patient outcomes, subject to further research. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

  abstract={Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are gaining importance with support of governments in the Western World. With evidence synthesis and economic modeling gaining in accuracy and complexity, there is an increasing demand to assess the quality and validity of the data used for these studies. In keeping with the trend of the "Big Data" explosion, "Real World Evidence" is being seen as the answer to getting HTAs to the next level of accuracy. Hence there is the need for better tools to document and process "Real World Data". Registries have been existing for more than half a century now. However; their use was primarily done for epidemiological research. This article discusses how with the turn of the century, registries have evolved from being just portals for enrolment of patients to being highly sophisticated tools for economic modeling and cost analysis. We also discuss the challenges faced in optimal utilization of registries and how they can be addressed by better designing and implementation. We also discuss some policy decisions which have been taken to ensure that registries will continue to evolve and be a very important tool in HTAs.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To summarize recent research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2015 in the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP).; METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section by searching bibliographic databases with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a clinical outcome. Section editors first selected a shortlist of candidate best papers that were then peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers.; RESULTS: The clinical NLP best paper selection shows that clinical NLP is making use of a variety of texts of clinical interest to contribute to the analysis of clinical information and the building of a body of clinical knowledge. The full review process highlighted five papers analyzing patient-authored texts or seeking to connect and aggregate multiple sources of information. They provide a contribution to the development of methods, resources, applications, and sometimes a combination of these aspects.; CONCLUSIONS: The field of clinical NLP continues to thrive through the contributions of both NLP researchers and healthcare professionals interested in applying NLP techniques to impact clinical practice. Foundational progress in the field makes it possible to leverage a larger variety of texts of clinical interest for healthcare purposes.},

  abstract={Background There is increasing evidence that invasive fungal disease (IFD) is more likely to occur in non-neutropenic patients in critical care units. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated antifungal prophylaxis in non-neutropenic, critically ill patients, demonstrating a reduction in the risk of proven IFD and suggesting a reduction in mortality. It is necessary to establish a method to identify and target antifungal prophylaxis at those patients at highest risk of IFD, who stand to benefit most from any antifungal prophylaxis strategy. Objectives To develop and validate risk models to identify non-neutropenic, critically ill adult patients at high risk of invasive Candida infection, who would benefit from antifungal prophylaxis, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeting antifungal prophylaxis to high-risk patients based on these models. Design Systematic review, prospective data collection, statistical modelling, economic decision modelling and value of information analysis. Setting Ninety-six UK adult general critical care units. Participants Consecutive admissions to participating critical care units. Interventions None. Main outcome measures Invasive fungal disease, defined as a blood culture or sample from a normally sterile site showing yeast/mould cells in a microbiological or histopathological report. For statistical and economic modelling, the primary outcome was invasive Candida infection, defined as IFD-positive for Candida species. Results Systematic review: Thirteen articles exploring risk factors, risk models or clinical decision rules for IFD in critically ill adult patients were identified. Risk factors reported to be significantly associated with IFD were included in the final data set for the prospective data collection. Data collection: Data were collected on 60,778 admissions between July 2009 and March 2011. Overall, 383 patients (0.6%) were admitted with or developed IFD. The majority of IFD patients (94%) were positive for Candida species. The most common site of infection was blood (55%). The incidence of IFD identified in unit was 4.7 cases per 1000 admissions, and for unit-acquired IFD was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions. Statistical modelling: Risk models were developed at admission to the critical care unit, 24 hours and the end of calendar day 3. The risk model at admission had fair discrimination (c-index 0.705). Discrimination improved at 24 hours (c-index 0.823) and this was maintained at the end of calendar day 3 (c-index 0.835). There was a drop in model performance in the validation sample. Economic decision model: Irrespective of risk threshold, incremental quality-adjusted life-years of prophylaxis strategies compared with current practice were positive but small compared with the incremental costs. Incremental net benefits of each prophylaxis strategy compared with current practice were all negative. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that current practice was the strategy most likely to be cost-effective. Across all parameters in the decision model, results indicated that the value of further research for the whole population of interest might be high relative to the research costs. Conclusions The results of the Fungal Infection Risk Evaluation (FIRE) Study, derived from a highly representative sample of adult general critical care units across the UK, indicated a low incidence of IFD among non-neutropenic, critically ill adult patients. IFD was associated with substantially higher mortality, more intensive organ support and longer length of stay. Risk modelling produced simple risk models that provided acceptable discrimination for identifying patients at 'high risk' of invasive Candida infection. Results of the economic model suggested that the current most cost-effective treatment strategy for prophylactic use of systemic antifungal agents among non-neutropenic, critically ill adult patients admitted to NHS adult general critical care units is a strategy of no risk assessment and no antifungal prophylaxis.

  abstract={Objective. The present review systematically examines the integration of language models to improve classifier performance in brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems. Approach. The domain of natural language has been studied extensively in linguistics and has been used in the natural language processing field in applications including information extraction, machine translation, and speech recognition. While these methods have been used for years in traditional augmentative and assistive communication devices, information about the output domain has largely been ignored in BCI communication systems. Over the last few years, BCI communication systems have started to leverage this information through the inclusion of language models. Main results. Although this movement began only recently, studies have already shown the potential of language integration in BCI communication and it has become a growing field in BCI research. BCI communication systems using language models in their classifiers have progressed down several parallel paths, including: word completion; signal classification; integration of process models; dynamic stopping; unsupervised learning; error correction; and evaluation. Significance. Each of these methods have shown significant progress, but have largely been addressed separately. Combining these methods could use the full potential of language model, yielding further performance improvements. This integration should be a priority as the field works to create a BCI system that meets the needs of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={High content screening (HCS), the large-scale automated analysis of the temporal and spatial changes in cells and cell constituents in arrays of cells, has the potential to create enormous systems cell biology knowledge bases. HCS is being employed along with the continuum of the early drug discovery process, including lead optimization where new knowledge is being used to facilitate the decision-making process. We demonstrate methodology to build new systems cell biology knowledge using a multiplexed HCS assay, designed with the aid of knowledge-mining tools, to measure the phenotypic response of a panel of human tumor cell types to a panel of natural product-derived microtubule-targeted anticancer agents and their synthetic analogs. We show how this new systems cell biology knowledge can be used to design a lead compound optimization strategy for at least two members of the panel, (-)-laulimalide and (+)-discodermolide, that exploits cell killing activity while minimally perturbing the regulation of the cell cycle and the stability of microtubules. Furthermore, this methodology can also be applied to basic biomedical research on cells. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Cardiovascular disease includes coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and peripheral vascular disease. We created a novel database and characterized CPMs based on the stage of development, population under study, performance, covariates, and predicted outcomes. There are 796 models included in this database. The number of CPMs published each year is increasing steadily over time. Seven hundred seventeen (90%) are de novo CPMs, 21 (3%) are CPM recalibrations, and 58 (7%) are CPM adaptations. This database contains CPMs for 31 index conditions, including 215 CPMs for patients with coronary artery disease, 168 CPMs for population samples, and 79 models for patients with heart failure. There are 77 distinct index/outcome pairings. Of the de novo models in this database, 450 (63%) report a c-statistic and 259 (36%) report some information on calibration. Conclusions - There is an abundance of CPMs available for a wide assortment of cardiovascular disease conditions, with substantial redundancy in the literature. The comparative performance of these models, the consistency of effects and risk estimates across models and the actual and potential clinical impact of this body of literature is poorly understood. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.},

  abstract={Purpose: Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of illness leading to hospitalization in young children. At present, many bronchiolitis management decisions are made subjectively, leading to significant practice variation among hospitals and physicians caring for children with bronchiolitis. To standardize care for bronchiolitis, researchers have proposed various models to predict the disease course to help determine a proper management plan. This paper reviews the existing state of the art of predictive modeling for bronchiolitis. Predictive modeling for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is covered whenever appropriate, as RSV accounts for about 70% of bronchiolitis cases. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through a PubMed search up to April 25, 2014. The literature on predictive modeling for bronchiolitis was retrieved using a comprehensive search query, which was developed through an iterative process. Search results were limited to human subjects, the English language, and children (birth to 18 years). Results: The literature search returned 2312 references in total. After manual review, 168 of these references were determined to be relevant and are discussed in this paper. We identify several limitations and open problems in predictive modeling for bronchiolitis, and provide some preliminary thoughts on how to address them, with the hope to stimulate future research in this domain. Conclusions: Many problems remain open in predictive modeling for bronchiolitis. Future studies will need to address them to achieve optimal predictive models. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Objective: To develop high-performance early sepsis prediction technology for the general patient population. Methods: Retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (from the MIMIC II dataset) who were not septic at the time of admission. Results: A sepsis early warning algorithm, InSight, was developed and applied to the prediction of sepsis up to three hours prior to a patient's first five hour Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) episode. When applied to a never-before-seen set of test patients, InSight predictions demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89-0.91) and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80-0.82), exceeding or rivaling that of existing biomarker detection methods. Across predictive times up to three hours before a sustained SIRS event, InSight maintained an average area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.86). Analysis of patient sepsis risk showed that contributions from the coevolution of multiple risk factors were more important than the contributions from isolated individual risk factors when making predictions further in advance. Conclusions: Sepsis can be predicted at least three hours in advance of onset of the first five hour SIRS episode, using only nine commonly available vital signs, with better performance than methods in standard practice today. High-order correlations of vital sign measurements are key to this prediction, which improves the likelihood of early identification of at-risk patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Background: Cardiotocography (CTG) records the fetal heart rate in relation to maternal uterine contractions and is one of the most common forms of fetal assessment during labour. Despite guidelines for CTG interpretation, substantial inter- and intra-observer variation in interpretation has been reported among maternity care providers. Misinterpretation of CTG readings can lead to poor decisions, which can result in unnecessary intervention or delay or withholding of necessary intervention. Expert systems (ESs) represent a type of applied artificial intelligence, which can assist in complex clinical decision-making and potentially serve as a mechanism to improve interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES compared with (1) continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour without an ES or (2) intermittent auscultation with a Pinard stethoscope or hand-held Doppler ultrasound device. Outcomes of interest included incidence of perinatal mortality, caesarean delivery, operative vaginal birth, fetal blood sampling, artificial rupture of amniotic membranes, oxytocin augmentation of labour, maternal satisfaction with labour, neonatal seizures, fetal acidaemia, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, admission to neonatal special care and/or neonatal intensive care unit and an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 October 2014), Open Grey (6 October 2014) ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database (6 October 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES with continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring without an ES were eligible for this review. Trials comparing continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES with intermittent auscultation with a Pinard or hand-held Doppler were also eligible. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of the trials as well as extracted data to ensure accuracy. The authors of included trials were contacted to clarify aspects of the study design that were not clearly reported in the original trial publications. Main results: No studies comparing CTG monitoring during labour with an ES to intermittent auscultation were identified. Two randomised controlled trials comparing CTG monitoring during labour with an ES versus CTG without an ES were identified and included in the qualitative synthesis of results, but only one trial (n = 220) provided data for quantitative analysis. Both trials were classified as low risk of bias. There was no strong evidence that CTG with an ES has an effect on the incidence of caesarean delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.04) when compared with CTG with fetal blood sampling. There was no strong evidence supporting a reduction in the incidence of neonatal seizures (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09) or fetal acidaemia (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.67) in women monitored using a CTG with an ES versus a CTG without an ES. Overall perinatal mortality could not be ascertained for this trial since data on early neonatal deaths were unavailable. Although fetal deaths were recorded, no fetal deaths occurred in either arm of the trial, and thus no risk estimates could be derived. There was no strong evidence supporting a reduction in the incidence of forceps-assisted vaginal birth (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.05 to 5.43), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.02) or an Apgar less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.95). The trial did not report on artificial rupture of amniotic membranes,oxytocin augmentation of labour ormaternal satisfaction with labour. Authors' conclusions: Two trials met the inclusion criteria for this review but one trial did not provide data for any of this review's outcomes. The single trial that did contribute data was underpowered to evaluate the association between CTG monitoring with an ES and the primary outcomes of interest. No recommendations for clinical practice can be made at this time. Adequately powered trials are necessary before the impact of ESs for fetal assessment in labour can be determined. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

  abstract={Objectives: To identify the predictive tools which have emerged recently in the field of urothelial carcinomas. Materials and methods: We performed a thorough MEDLINE literature review using a combination of the following keywords: urothelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, predictive tools, predictive models and nomograms. We found 117 articles, but only the relevant reports were selected. Results: The majority of available tools are prediction models, particularly nomograms. These models combine good performance accuracy with ease of use. They appear to be more accurate than risk grouping or tree modeling and are more suitable for clinicians than artificial intelligence. The most recent nomograms have been designed to be used in daily clinical practice and are even available as computer or smartphone applications. They focus on pathological outcomes or more frequently on survival statistics or recurrence risk after surgery. They provide an accurate prediction of disease evolution and may help clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment option. However, these prediction tools still need to be validated and regularly utilized. Conclusion: Predictive tools represent very helpful clinical decision-making aids but need to be validated in larger populations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dash-board design options. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

  abstract={Background context In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of decision analysis studies in the spine literature. Although there are several published reviews on the different types of decision analysis (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-utility), there is limited information in the spine literature regarding the mathematical models used in these studies (decision tree, Markov modeling, Monte Carlo simulation). Purpose The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the types of decision analytic models used in spine surgery. A secondary aim was to provide a systematic overview of the most cited studies in the spine literature. Study design/setting This is a systematic review of the available information from all sources regarding decision analytics and economic modeling in spine surgery. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane review was performed to identify the most relevant peer-reviewed literature of decision analysis/cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) models including decisions trees, Markov models, and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, CEA models based on investigational drug exemption studies were reviewed in particular detail, as these studies are prime candidates for economic modeling. Results The initial review of the literature resulted in 712 abstracts. After two reviewer-assessment of abstract relevance and methodologic quality, 19 studies were selected: 12 with decision tree constructs and 7 with Markov models. Each study was assessed for methodologic quality and a review of the overall results of the model. A generalized overview of the mathematical construction and methodology of each type of model was also performed. Limitations, strengths, and potential applications to spine research were further explored. Conclusions Decision analytic modeling represents a powerful tool both in the assessment of competing treatment options and potentially in the formulation of policy and reimbursement. Our review provides a generalized overview and a conceptual framework to help spine physicians with the construction of these models. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={There is a consensus among scientists that the analysis of Big Data in health care (such as electronic health records, patient reported outcomes or inmotion data) can improve clinical research and the quality of care provided to patients. Yet there is little knowledge about the actual effectiveness of Big Data in the health care sector. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature in order to determine the extent to which Big Data applications in health care systems have managed to improve patient experiences and clinicians' behavior as well as the quality of care provided to patients. All searches for relevant articles were performed in the PubMed database. From the 108 potentially relevant articles 12 satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study. The findings showed that in the case of nine articles the researchers reported positive effect of Big Data. However, some negative results were recorded in the case of three articles. The main benefits of Big Data application involved positive behavior change, improved usability and efficient decision support. However, problems were identified for technology acceptance. Most problems occurred in the case of systems processing heterogeneous datasets, patient reported outcomes and in motion data, as opposed to electronic health record systems. The paper concludes by highlighting some areas of investigation where further research is needed to understand the use of Big Data in health care and improve its effectiveness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

  abstract={Inadequate pain assessment, increased medical expenditure, decreased productivity and improper treatment are the global challenging problems which often lead to hindrances and loss of interest in life. Intelligent computing systems (ICS) play a significant role in improving the accuracy of pain assessment and supporting the health care practitioners in the clinical decision-making process. The computational aspects of pain assessment, to acquire knowledge from the clinical data received by patients or experts, are focused in this review. The method used an extensive literature search in various reputed journals and electronic databases in order to extract the articles related to ICS considering both chronic and acute pain symptoms of patients, published between 1992 and 2014 in the English language. In total, forty-five studies were analyzed, thirty-two were selected from 1320 citations, and ten were obtained from reference tracking. The computer technologies identified were grouped together into following four categories in the result section comprising of artificial neural networks, rule-based algorithms, statistical learning algorithms and nonstandard set theory. Methodologies such as questionnaires, scores and terminologies were found for content processing. Literature suggests that the current state of the art focuses on the real-time aspects of pain assessment through facial expressions, demanding the design of ICS to incorporate these issues which provided better accuracy. It would contribute to clinical practice if well-designed computerized methodologies would streamline the process of patient assessment, increasing its accessibility to physicians and improving quality of care. © 2016, The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

Information technology and data exchange standards enable rapid extraction, summarization, and visualization of information and derived knowledge from these data sets. Clinical trials data was extracted in the XML format from the National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov site. This data includes categories such as 'Summary of Purpose', 'Trial Sponsor', 'Phase of the Trial', 'Recruiting Status', and 'Location'. We focused on 645 clinical trials related to cancer vaccines. Additional facts on cancer types, including incidence and survival rates, were retrieved from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance data. Results. This application enables rapid extraction of information about institutions, diseases, clinical approaches, clinical trials dates, predominant cancer types in the trials, clinical opportunities and pharmaceutical market coverage. Presentation of results is facilitated by visualization tools that summarize the landscape of ongoing and completed cancer vaccine trials. Our summaries show the number of clinical vaccine trials per cancer type, over time, by phase, by lead sponsors, as well as trial activity relative to cancer type and survival data. We also have identified cancers that are neglected in the cancer vaccine field: bladder, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and all of the low-incidence cancers. Conclusion. We have developed a data mining approach that enables rapid extraction of complex data from the major clinical trial repository. Summarization and visualization of these data represents a cost-effective means of making informed decisions about future cancer vaccine clinical trials. © 2008 Cao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract={Major reported factors associated with the limited effectiveness of home telemonitoring interventions in chronic respiratory conditions include the lack of useful early predictors, poor patient compliance and the poor performance of conventional algorithms for detecting deteriorations. This article provides a systematic review of existing algorithms and the factors associated with their performance in detecting exacerbations and supporting clinical decisions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. An electronic literature search in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library was conducted to identify relevant articles published between 2005 and July 2015. A total of 20 studies (16 COPD, 4 asthma) that included research about the use of algorithms in telemonitoring interventions in asthma and COPD were selected. Differences on the applied definition of exacerbation, telemonitoring duration, acquired physiological signals and symptoms, type of technology deployed and algorithms used were found. Predictive models with good clinically reliability have yet to be defined, and are an important goal for the future development of telehealth in chronic respiratory conditions. New predictive models incorporating both symptoms and physiological signals are being tested in telemonitoring interventions with positive outcomes. However, the underpinning algorithms behind these models need be validated in larger samples of patients, for longer periods of time and with well-established protocols. In addition, further research is needed to identify novel predictors that enable the early detection of deteriorations, especially in COPD. Only then will telemonitoring achieve the aim of preventing hospital admissions, contributing to the reduction of health resource utilization and improving the quality of life of patients. © The Author(s) 2016.},

  abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the utility of clinical processes in healthcare institutions of different sizes. The implications of adoption rate of computerized physicians order entry (CPOE) and electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs) in different sized healthcare institutions in the USA were studied in terms of understanding its impact on enhancement of quality of patient care. Design/methodology/approach - This study has used secondary data to obtain insights on the processes and technologies used in hospitals of different sizes in the USA and enlighten those in the developing countries to adopt a strategy that would be most appropriate for them. The Dorenfest Institute for H.I.T. Research and Education Analytics database (The Dorenfest Institute, 2011) provided the data for 5,038 US hospitals. Logistic regression was performed to study the impact of the different types of processes and technologies on institutions of different sizes, classified based on the number of beds, physicians, and nurses. Findings - The findings show that small sized hospitals had a positive relationship with drug dosing interactions process and nursing and clinician content process. On the contrary, medium sized hospitals had a negative relationship with the usage of CPOE for entering medical records, i.e. <25 percent ( p <0.05). In order to be effective, these institutions should increase the usage of EMRs by more than 25 percent to get positive outcomes. Large hospitals showed a positive relationship with the usage of >75 percent of CPOE to enter medical records and usage of medical records >75 percent. Practical implications - The authors demonstrate the need for an evaluation of utility of acute care hospitals based on hospital size in terms of number of physicians, and nurses, which have not been dealt earlier by the past studies. Moreover, there is also a need for an evaluation of utility of acute care hospitals for implementation of CPOEs and EMRs that are integrated with clinical decision support systems. Originality/value - Although the data are US-centric, the insights provided by the results are very much relevant to the Indian scenario to support the improvement of the quality of care. The findings may help those implementing processes in healthcare institutions in India. No study has addressed the measurement of the positive and negative outcomes arising due to the implementation of different percentages of CPOEs and EMRs in different sized institutions. Further the number of physicians and nurses have not been considered earlier. Therefore, the authors have classified the hospitals based on physicians and nurses and studied their impact on the adoption of CPOEs, clinical decision support systems, and EMRs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It constitutes an overview of empirical evidence behind key objectives of the potential adoption of LA/EDM in generic educational strategic planning. We examined the literature on experimental case studies conducted in the domain during the past six years (2008-2013). Search terms identified 209 mature pieces of research work, but inclusion criteria limited the key studies to 40. We analyzed the research questions, methodology and findings of these published papers and categorized them accordingly. We used non-statistical methods to evaluate and interpret findings of the collected studies. The results have highlighted four distinct major directions of the LA/EDM empirical research. We discuss on the emerged added value of LA/EDM research and highlight the significance of further implications. Finally, we set our thoughts on possible uncharted key questions to investigate both from pedagogical and technical considerations.},

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic review of real-time Business Intelligence (RTBI) literature through a grounded theory lens in five RTBI research areas: Presentation (of information), Analytics, Data Integration, Processes, and Soft Factors. The main contribution of the paper is in the summary of metainformation, such as research methods and industry sectors, and in the synopsis of RTBI related research in these five research streams. Reviewing 138 articles in leading IS journals and conferences during the years 2000-2015, we found that the current top priorities of RTBI research focus on (a) the Analytics layer (36,2% of the identified articles) which incorporates all challenges related to automated data analysis and (b) the Data Integration layer (32,1% of the identified articles), which covers all components necessary for securing an appropriate data quality. Our findings indicate, that the dominance of these two research streams may marginalize the status of the Presentation layer and Soft Factors of RTBI. Future RTBI research may benefit from studies incorporating a broader theoretical perspective to integrate concepts and findings across all five research streams. Based on our analysis we derive eight promising research directions, which will provide scholars with a basis on how to pursue when designing future research.},

  abstract={Objective: To conduct a comprehensive survey of mobile health (mHealth) research initiatives in Brazil, discussing current challenges, gaps, opportunities and tendencies. Methods: Systematic review of publicly available electronic documents related to mHealth, including scientific publications, technical reports and descriptions of commercial products. Specifically, 42 projects are analyzed and classified according to their goals. This analysis considers aspects such as security features provided (if any), the health condition that are focus of attention, the main providers involved in the projects development and deployment, types of devices used, target users, where the projects are tested and/or deployed, among others. Results: The study shows a large number (86%) of mHealth solutions focused on the following categories: health surveys, surveillance, patient records and monitoring. Meanwhile, treatment compliance, awareness raising and decision support systems are less explored. The main providers of solutions are the universities (56%) and health units (32%), with considerable cooperation between such entities. Most applications have physicians (55%) and Community Health Agents (CHAs) (33%) as targeted users, the latter being important elements in nation-wide governmental health programs. Projects focused on health managers, however, are a minority (5%). The majority of projects do not focus on specific diseases but rather general health (57%), although solutions for hearth conditions are reasonably numerous (21%). Finally, the lack of security mechanisms in the majority of the surveyed solutions (52%) may hinder their deployment in the field due to the lack of compliance with general regulations for medical data handling. Conclusion: There are currently many mHealth initiatives in Brazil, but some areas have not been much explored, such as solutions for treatment compliance and awareness raising, as well as decision support systems. Another research trend worth exploring refers to creating interoperable security mechanisms, especially for widely explored mHealth categories such as health surveys, patient records and monitoring. Challenges for the expansion of mHealth solutions, both in number and coverage, include the further involvement of health managers in the deployment of such solutions and in coordinating efforts among health and research institutions interested in the mHealth trend, possibly exploring the widespread presence of CHAs around the country as users of such technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract={Background: It is estimated that one million people infected with HIV initiate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained countries annually. This occurs against a background of overburdened health workers with limited skills to handle rapidly changing treatment standards and guidelines hence compromising quality of care. Electronic medical record (EMR)-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are considered a solution to improve quality of care. Little evidence, however, exists on the effectiveness of EMR-based CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-constrained settings. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify original studies on EMR-based CDSS describing process and outcome measures as well as reported barriers to their implementation in resource-constrained settings. We characterized the studies by guideline adherence, data and process, and barriers to CDSS implementation. Methods: Two reviewers independently assessed original articles from a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Global Health Library databases until January 2012. The included articles were those that evaluated or described the implementation of EMR-based CDSS that were used in HIV care in low-income countries. Results: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, 10 of which were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and 2 in the Caribbean. None of the papers described a strong (randomized controlled) evaluation design. Guideline adherence: One study showed that ordering rates for CD4 tests were significantly higher when reminders were used. Data and process: Studies reported reduction in data errors, reduction in missed appointments, reduction in missed CD4 results and reduction in patient waiting time. Two studies showed a significant increase in time spent by clinicians on direct patient care. Barriers to CDSS implementation: Technical infrastructure problems such as unreliable electric power and erratic Internet connectivity, clinicians' limited computer skills and failure by providers to comply with the reminders are key impediments to the implementation and effective use of CDSS. Conclusion: The limited number of evaluation studies, the basic and heterogeneous study designs, and varied outcome measures make it difficult to meaningfully conclude on the effectiveness of CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings. High quality evaluation studies are needed. Factors specific to implementation of EMR-based CDSS in resource-limited setting should be addressed before such countries can demonstrate its full benefits. More work needs to be done to overcome the barriers to EMR and CDSS implementation in developing countries such as technical infrastructure and care providers' computer illiteracy. However, simultaneously evaluating and describing CDSS implementation strategies that work can further guide wise investments in their wider rollout. © 2012.},

  abstract={Purpose: Artificial intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks, Bayesian belief networks and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems, are complex mathematical models based on the human neuronal structure and thinking. Such tools are capable of generating data driven models of biological systems without making assumptions based on statistical distributions. A large amount of study has been reported of the use of artificial intelligence in urology. We reviewed the basic concepts behind artificial intelligence techniques and explored the applications of this new dynamic technology in various aspects of urological cancer management. Materials and Methods: A detailed and systematic review of the literature was performed using the MEDLINE® and Inspec® databases to discover reports using artificial intelligence in urological cancer. Results: The characteristics of machine learning and their implementation were described and reports of artificial intelligence use in urological cancer were reviewed. While most researchers in this field were found to focus on artificial neural networks to improve the diagnosis, staging and prognostic prediction of urological cancers, some groups are exploring other techniques, such as expert systems and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems. Conclusions: Compared to traditional regression statistics artificial intelligence methods appear to be accurate and more explorative for analyzing large data cohorts. Furthermore, they allow individualized prediction of disease behavior. Each artificial intelligence method has characteristics that make it suitable for different tasks. The lack of transparency of artificial neural networks hinders global scientific community acceptance of this method but this can be overcome by neuro-fuzzy modeling systems. © 2007 American Urological Association.},

To determine the effectiveness of order sets in improving guideline adherence, treatment outcomes, processes of care, efficiency, and cost, we conducted a systematic review of the literature. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in various databases for studies published between January 1, 1990, and April 18, 2009. A total of eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. No randomized controlled trials were found. Results: Outcomes of the included studies were summarized qualitatively due to variations in study population, intervention type, and outcome measures. There were no important inconsistencies between the results reported by studies involving different types of order sets. While the studies generally suggested positive outcomes, they were typically of low quality, with simple before-after designs and other methodological limitations. Conclusions: The benefits of order sets remain eminently plausible, but given the paucity of high quality evidence, further investigations to formally evaluate the effectiveness of order sets would be highly valuable. © Copyright 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract={Cytological evaluation by microscopic image-based characterization [imprint cytology (IC) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)] plays an integral role in primary screening/detection of breast cancer. The sensitivity of IC and FNAC as a screening tool is dependent on the image quality and the pathologist's level of expertise. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used to assists the pathologists by developing various machine learning and image processing algorithms. This study reviews the various manual and computer-aided techniques used so far in breast cytology. Diagnostic applications were studied to estimate the role of CAD in breast cancer diagnosis. This paper presents an overview of image processing and pattern recognition techniques that have been used to address several issues in breast cytology-based CAD including slide preparation, staining, microscopic imaging, pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and diagnostic classification. This review provides better insights to readers regarding the state of the art the knowledge on CAD-based breast cancer diagnosis to date. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Background: A myriad of new tools and algorithms have been developed to help public health professionals analyze and visualize the complex data used in infectious disease control. To better understand approaches to meet these users' information needs, we conducted a systematic literature review focused on the landscape of infectious disease visualization tools for public health professionals, with a special emphasis on geographic information systems (GIS), molecular epidemiology, and social network analysis. The objectives of this review are to: (1) identify public health user needs and preferences for infectious disease information visualization tools; (2) identify existing infectious disease information visualization tools and characterize their architecture and features; (3) identify commonalities among approaches applied to different data types; and (4) describe tool usability evaluation efforts and barriers to the adoption of such tools. Methods: We identified articles published in English from January 1, 1980 to June 30, 2013 from five bibliographic databases. Articles with a primary focus on infectious disease visualization tools, needs of public health users, or usability of information visualizations were included in the review. Results: A total of 88 articles met our inclusion criteria. Users were found to have diverse needs, preferences and uses for infectious disease visualization tools, and the existing tools are correspondingly diverse. The architecture of the tools was inconsistently described, and few tools in the review discussed the incorporation of usability studies or plans for dissemination. Many studies identified concerns regarding data sharing, confidentiality and quality. Existing tools offer a range of features and functions that allow users to explore, analyze, and visualize their data, but the tools are often for siloed applications. Commonly cited barriers to widespread adoption included lack of organizational support, access issues, and misconceptions about tool use. Discussion and conclusion: As the volume and complexity of infectious disease data increases, public health professionals must synthesize highly disparate data to facilitate communication with the public and inform decisions regarding measures to protect the public's health. Our review identified several themes: consideration of users' needs, preferences, and computer literacy; integration of tools into routine workflow; complications associated with understanding and use of visualizations; and the role of user trust and organizational support in the adoption of these tools. Interoperability also emerged as a prominent theme, highlighting challenges associated with the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of infectious disease control and prevention. Future work should address methods for representing uncertainty and missing data to avoid misleading users as well as strategies to minimize cognitive overload. © 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract={Objective: To review evidence of the effectiveness of information technology (IT) interventions to improve antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals. Method: MEDLINE (1950-March 2015), EMBASE (1947-March 2015) and PubMED (1966-March 2015) were searched for studies where an IT intervention involving any device (e.g. computer, mobile phone) was evaluated in practice. All papers were assessed for quality using a 10-point rating scale. Results: We identified 45 articles that evaluated an IT intervention to improve antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals. IT interventions took four main forms: (1) stand-alone computerized decision support systems (CDSSs), (2) decision support embedded within a hospital's electronic medical record (EMR) or computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, (3) computerized antimicrobial approval systems (cAAS), and (4) surveillance systems (SSs). Results reported allowed us to perform meta-analyses for three outcome measures: appropriate use of antimicrobials, patient mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS). IT interventions increased appropriate use of antimicrobials (pooled RR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.07-2.08); however no evidence of an effect was found when analysis included only studies with a quality score of five or above on the 10-point quality scale (pooled RR: 1.53, 95%CI: 0.96-2.44). There was little evidence of an effect of IT interventions on patient mortality or LOS. The range of study designs and outcome measures prevented meaningful comparisons between different IT intervention types to be made. Conclusion: IT interventions can improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing. However, high quality, systematic multi-site comparative studies are critically needed to assist organizations in making informed decisions about the most effective IT interventions. © 2016.},

  abstract={Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have been shown to improve clinical performance and patient outcomes, but the failure rate of such systems is still over 50 percent. To contribute to a wider understanding of issues surrounding CDDS acceptance, we performed a systematic review of studies that evaluated CDSS implementations in clinical care to determine the factors that are associated with acceptance of CDSS by physicians. The factors that were found were categorized according to the HOT-fit framework. The mapping of factors concerning CDSS acceptance on the HOT-fit framework revealed gaps in each domain of the framework and showed that research has mainly focused on human and technology factors and a lack of research on organizational factors. A potential area of research could thus be studying the organizational factors that may influence CDSS acceptance. © 2011 European Federation for Medical Informatics. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Cardiovascular disease is a deadly global health crisis that carries a substantial financial burden. Innovative treatment and management of cardiovascular disease straddles medicine, personalized hemodynamic modeling, machine learning, and modern imaging to help improve patient outcomes and reduce the economic impact. Hemodynamic modeling offers a non-invasive method to provide clinicians with new pre- and post- procedural metrics and aid in the selection of treatment options. Medical imaging is an integral part in clinical workflows for understanding and managing cardiac disease and interventions. Coupling machine learning with modeling, and cardiovascular imaging, provides faster modeling, improved data fidelity, and an enhanced understanding and earlier detection of cardiovascular anomalies, leading to the development of patient-specific diagnostic and predictive tools for characterizing and assessing cardiovascular outcomes. Herein, we provide a scoping review of translational hemodynamic modeling, medical imaging, and machine learning and their applications to cardiovascular interventions. We particularly focus on providing an intuitive understanding of each of these approaches and their ability to support decision making during important clinical milestones.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={Purpose of Review: In this study, we planned and carried out a scoping review of the literature to learn how machine learning (ML) has been investigated in cardiovascular imaging (CVI). Recent Findings: During our search, we found numerous studies that developed or utilized existing ML models for segmentation, classification, object detection, generation, and regression applications involving cardiovascular imaging data. We first quantitatively investigated the different aspects of study characteristics, data handling, model development, and performance evaluation in all studies that were included in our review. We then supplemented these findings with a qualitative synthesis to highlight the common themes in the studied literature and provided recommendations to pave the way for upcoming research. Summary: ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn human-like decision-making from data. Due to its novel applications, ML is gaining more and more attention from researchers in the healthcare industry. Cardiovascular imaging is an active area of research in medical imaging with lots of room for incorporating new technologies, like ML. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led us to use virtual solutions and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the role of AI in health care and medical practice; however, a comprehensive review can identify potential yet not fulfilled functionalities of such technologies in pandemics. Therefore, this scoping review study aims at assessing AI functionalities in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Cochran Library, Scopus, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science from 2019 to May 9, 2022. Researchers selected the articles according to the search keywords. Finally, the articles mentioning the functionalities of AI in the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated. Two investigators performed this process. Results: Initial search resulted in 9123 articles. After reviewing the title, abstract, and full text of these articles, and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 4 articles were selectd for the final analysis. All 4 were cross-sectional studies. Two studies (50%) were performed in the United States, 1 (25%) in Israel, and 1 (25%) in Saudi Arabia. They covered the functionalities of AI in the prediction, detection, and diagnosis of COVID-19. Conclusions: To the extent of the researchers' knowledge, this study is the first scoping review that assesses the AI functionalities in the COVID-19 pandemic. Health-care organizations need decision support technologies and evidence-based apparatuses that can perceive, think, and reason not dissimilar to human beings. Potential functionalities of such technologies can be used to predict mortality, detect, screen, and trace current and former patients, analyze health data, prioritize high-risk patients, and better allocate hospital resources in pandemics, and generally in health-care settings.  © 2023 The Author(s).

  abstract={A scoping review methodology was used to assess player readiness via indicators of neuromuscular function in response to training load. Literature search included PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus, and CINAHL. Search strategy was based on Population-Concept-Context framework evaluating football code athletes with the focus on player readiness in the context of longitudinal monitoring across quantified training loads with an emphasis on neuromuscular function. Demographics, frequency of data collection, methods of monitoring readiness, neuromuscular function, duration of monitoring period, and quantification of training loads were reported. Authors independently reviewed articles and, in the case of disagreement, a vote determined inclusion. The sports of rugby (n = 13) and soccer (n = 11) were most frequently examined, followed by Australian Rules Football (n = 6) and American Football (n = 1). The most common methods assessed systemic readiness with the primary focus on jump and sprint testing. Findings identified limited evidence supporting structural and tissue-specific monitoring tools. Player readiness assessment strategies have evolved with advances in technology and analytics. It is recommended that future research focus on a variety of populations, including youth and women athletes. This review is the first to summarize methods of assessing player readiness using indicators of neuromuscular function in football code athletes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. METHODS: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS: From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. CONCLUSIONS: This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

  abstract={Background: With the rising prevalence of diabetes, machine learning (ML) models have been increasingly used for prediction of diabetes and its complications, due to their ability to handle large complex data sets. This study aims to evaluate the quality and performance of ML models developed to predict microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications in an adult Type 2 diabetes population. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE®, Embase®, the Cochrane® Library, Web of Science®, and DBLP Computer Science Bibliography databases according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Studies that developed or validated ML prediction models for microvascular or macrovascular complications in people with Type 2 diabetes were included. Prediction performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AUC >0.75 indicates clearly useful discrimination performance, while a positive mean relative AUC difference indicates better comparative model performance. Results: Of 13 606 articles screened, 32 studies comprising 87 ML models were included. Neural networks (n = 15) were the most frequently utilized. Age, duration of diabetes, and body mass index were common predictors in ML models. Across predicted outcomes, 36% of the models demonstrated clearly useful discrimination. Most ML models reported positive mean relative AUC compared with non-ML methods, with random forest showing the best overall performance for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. Majority (n = 31) of studies had high risk of bias. Conclusions: Random forest was found to have the overall best prediction performance. Current ML prediction models remain largely exploratory, and external validation studies are required before their clinical implementation.

  abstract={Remote learning has advanced from the theoretical to the practical sciences with the advent of virtual labs. Although virtual labs allow students to conduct their experiments remotely, it is a challenge to evaluate student progress and collaboration using learning analytics. So far, a study that systematically synthesizes the status of research on virtual laboratories and learning analytics does not exist, which is a gap our study aimed to fill. This study aimed to synthesize the empirical research on learning analytics in virtual labs by conducting a systematic review. We reviewed 21 articles that were published between 2015 and 2021. The results of the study showed that 48% of studies were conducted in higher education, with the main focus on the medical field. There is a wide range of virtual lab platforms, and most of the learning analytics used in the reviewed articles were derived from student log files for students’ actions. Learning analytics was utilized to measure the performance, activities, perception, and behavior of students in virtual labs. The studies cover a wide variety of research domains, platforms, and analytical approaches. Therefore, the landscape of platforms and applications is fragmented, small-scale, and exploratory, and has thus far not tapped into the potential of learning analytics to support learning and teaching. Therefore, educators may need to find common standards, protocols, or platforms to build on each others’ findings and advance our knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: Combining text mining (TM) and clinical decision support (CDS) could improve diagnostic and therapeutic processes in clinical practice. This review summarizes current knowledge of the TM-CDS combination in clinical practice, including their intended purpose, implementation in clinical practice, and barriers to such implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify full-text English language studies published before January 2022 with TM-CDS combination in clinical practice. RESULTS: Of 714 identified and screened unique publications, 39 were included. The majority of the included studies are related to diagnosis (n = 26) or prognosis (n = 11) and used a method that was developed for a specific clinical domain, document type, or application. Most of the studies selected text containing parts of the electronic health record (EHR), such as reports (41%, n = 16) and free-text narratives (36%, n = 14), and 23 studies utilized a tool that had software "developed for the study". In 15 studies, the software source was openly available. In 79% of studies, the tool was not implemented in clinical practice. Barriers to implement these tools included the complexity of natural language, EHR incompleteness, validation and performance of the tool, lack of input from an expert team, and the adoption rate among professionals. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence indicates that the TM-CDS combination may improve diagnostic and therapeutic processes, contributing to increased patient safety. However, further research is needed to identify barriers to implementation and the impact of such tools in clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2022.

  abstract={Computational methods have gained prominence in healthcare research. The accessibility of healthcare data has greatly incited academicians and researchers to develop executions that help in prognosis of cancer drug response. Among various computational methods, machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) methods provide the most consistent and effectual approaches to handle the serious aftermaths of the deadly disease and drug administered to the patients. Hence, this systematic literature review has reviewed researches that have investigated drug discovery and prognosis of anticancer drug response using ML and DL algorithms. Fot this purpose, PRISMA guidelines have been followed to choose research papers from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Sciencedirect websites. A total count of 105 papers that align with the context of this review were chosen. Further, the review also presents accuracy of the existing ML and DL methods in the prediction of anticancer drug response. It has been found from the review that, amidst the availability of various studies, there are certain challenges associated with each method. Thus, future researchers can consider these limitations and challenges to develop a prominent anticancer drug response prediction method, and it would be greatly beneficial to the medical professionals in administering non-invasive treatment to the patients. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Knee pain is highly prevalent worldwide, and this number is expected to rise in the future. The COVID-19 outbreak, in combination with the aging population, rising health care costs, and the need to make health care more accessible worldwide, has led to an increasing demand for digital health care applications to deliver care for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. Digital health and other forms of telemedicine can add value in optimizing health care for patients and health care providers. This might reduce health care costs and make health care more accessible while maintaining a high level of quality. Although expectations are high, there is currently no overview comparing digital health applications with face-to-face contact in clinical trials to establish a primary knee diagnosis in orthopedic surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the currently available digital health and telemedicine applications to establish a primary knee diagnosis in orthopedic surgery in the general population in comparison with imaging or face-to-face contact between patients and physicians. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting methods to determine a primary knee diagnosis in orthopedic surgery using digital health or telemedicine. On April 28 and 29, 2021, searches were conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase. Data charting was conducted using a predefined form and included details on general study information, study population, type of application, comparator, analyses, and key findings. A risk-of-bias analysis was not deemed relevant considering the scoping review design of the study. RESULTS: After screening 5639 articles, 7 (0.12%) were included. In total, 2 categories to determine a primary diagnosis were identified: screening studies (4/7, 57%) and decision support studies (3/7, 43%). There was great heterogeneity in the included studies in algorithms used, disorders, input parameters, and outcome measurements. No more than 25 knee disorders were included in the studies. The included studies showed a relatively high sensitivity (67%-91%). The accuracy of the different studies was generally lower, with a specificity of 27% to 48% for decision support studies and 73% to 96% for screening studies. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review shows that there are a limited number of available applications to establish a remote diagnosis of knee disorders in orthopedic surgery. To date, there is limited evidence that digital health applications can assist patients or orthopedic surgeons in establishing the primary diagnosis of knee disorders. Future research should aim to integrate multiple sources of information and a standardized study design with close collaboration among clinicians, data scientists, data managers, lawyers, and service users to create reliable and secure databases. ©Sander C van Eijck, Daan M Janssen, Maria C van der Steen, Eugenie J L G Delvaux, Johannes G E Hendriks, Rob P A Janssen.

  abstract={The term Learner Profile has proliferated over the years, and more recently, with the increased advocacy around personalising learning experiences. Learner profiles are at the center of personalised learning, and the characterisation of diversity in classrooms is made possible by profiling learners based on their strengths and weaknesses, backgrounds and other factors influencing learning. In this paper, we discuss three common approaches of profiling learners based on students' cognitive knowledge, skills and competencies and behavioral patterns, all latter commonly used within Learning Analytics (LA). Although each approach has its strengths and merits, there are also several disadvantages that have impeded adoption at scale. We propose that the broader adoption of learner profiles can benefit from careful combination of the methods and practices of three primary approaches, allowing for scalable implementation of learner profiles across educational systems. In this regard, LA can leverage from other aligned domains to develop valid and rigorous measures of students' learning and propel learner profiles from education research to more mainstream educational practice. LA could provide the scope for monitoring and reporting beyond an individualised context and allow holistic evaluations of progress. There is promise in LA research to leverage the growing momentum surrounding learner profiles and make a substantial impact on the field's core aim - understanding and optimising learning as it occurs.  © 2023 ACM.},

  abstract={Traditional machine learning methods face unique challenges when applied to healthcare predictive analytics. The high-dimensional nature of healthcare data necessitates labor-intensive and time-consuming processes when selecting an appropriate set of features for each new task. Furthermore, machine learning methods depend heavily on feature engineering to capture the sequential nature of patient data, oftentimes failing to adequately leverage the temporal patterns of medical events and their dependencies. In contrast, recent deep learning (DL) methods have shown promising performance for various healthcare prediction tasks by specifically addressing the high-dimensional and temporal challenges of medical data. DL techniques excel at learning useful representations of medical concepts and patient clinical data as well as their nonlinear interactions from high-dimensional raw or minimally processed healthcare data.In this article, we systematically reviewed research works that focused on advancing deep neural networks to leverage patient structured time series data for healthcare prediction tasks. To identify relevant studies, we searched MEDLINE, IEEE, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library for relevant publications through November 4, 2021. Overall, we found that researchers have contributed to deep time series prediction literature in 10 identifiable research streams: DL models, missing value handling, addressing temporal irregularity, patient representation, static data inclusion, attention mechanisms, interpretation, incorporation of medical ontologies, learning strategies, and scalability. This study summarizes research insights from these literature streams, identifies several critical research gaps, and suggests future research opportunities for DL applications using patient time series data.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract={As most lung cancer (LC) cases are still detected at advanced and incurable stages, there are increasing efforts to foster detection at earlier stages by low dose computed tomography (LDCT) based LC screening. In this scoping review, we describe current advances in candidate selection for screening (selection phase), technical aspects (screening), and probability evaluation of malignancy of CT-detected pulmonary nodules (PN management). Literature was non-systematically assessed and reviewed for suitability by the authors. For the selection phase, we describe current eligibility criteria for screening, along with their limitations and potential refinements through advanced clinical scores and biomarker assessments. For LC screening, we discuss how the accuracy of computerized tomography (CT) scan reading might be augmented by IT tools, helping radiologists to cope with increasing workloads. For PN management, we evaluate the precision of follow-up scans by semi-automatic volume measurements of CT-detected PN. Moreover, we present an integrative approach to evaluate the probability of PN malignancy to enable safe decisions on further management. As a clear limitation, additional validation studies are required for most innovative diagnostic approaches presented in this article, but the integration of clinical risk models, current imaging techniques, and advancing biomarker research has the potential to improve the LC screening performance generally. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Introduction: The digitization of hospital systems, including integrated electronic medical records, has provided opportunities to improve the prediction performance of inpatient fall risk models and their application to computerized clinical decision support systems. This review describes the data sources and scope of methods reported in studies that developed inpatient fall prediction models, including machine learning and more traditional approaches to inpatient fall risk prediction. Methods: This scoping review used methods recommended by the Arksey and O'Malley framework and its recent advances. PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched. Studies reporting the development of inpatient fall risk prediction approaches were included. There was no restriction on language or recency. Reference lists and manual searches were also completed. Reporting quality was assessed using adherence to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis statement (TRIPOD), where appropriate. Results: Database searches identified 1,396 studies, 63 were included for scoping assessment and 45 for reporting quality assessment. There was considerable overlap in data sources and methods used for model development. Fall prediction models typically relied on features from patient assessments, including indicators of physical function or impairment, or cognitive function or impairment. All but two studies used patient information at or soon after admission and predicted fall risk over the entire admission, without consideration of post-admission interventions, acuity changes or length of stay. Overall, reporting quality was poor, but improved in the past decade. Conclusion: There was substantial homogeneity in data sources and prediction model development methods. Use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning with high-dimensional data, remains underexplored in the context of hospital falls. Future research should consider approaches with the potential to utilize high-dimensional data from digital hospital systems, which may contribute to greater performance and clinical usefulness.  © 2023 S.

  abstract={Although advances in insulin therapy and delivery have been made, global evidence indicates sub-optimal glycemic management in people on insulin therapy with either type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this review, we discuss connected insulin pens that include tracking insulin pens (TIPs) and smart insulin pens (SIPs) and caps, as approaches to improving mean glucose or time in range while minimizing exposure to hypoglycemia or time below range (TBR) in people with diabetes (PwD) on multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. We discuss various factors offered by SIPs that can facilitate precision insulin management, that is, delivering the right dose at the right time. These factors include the automatic recording of insulin dose size and delivery time; differentiating prime from therapy doses; active insulin tracking; dose calculators that provide individualized dosing recommendations; alerts for missed doses (ie, rapid-acting or long-acting insulin), insulin temperature, and insulin age monitoring; and integrated data reports for the clinical care team. A data-driven approach to care is critical to precision insulin management and includes helping PwD make informed choices regarding their preferred method of insulin delivery and ensuring insulin delivery technology tools are configured for their personal therapy plan. The data-driven approach involves developing a plan for ongoing collaborative use of the resulting data with their care team that may include adjusting insulin regimen and optimizing the care plan on a timely basis. We conclude with a list of practice protocols that are needed to support data-driven precision insulin management. This review includes a summary of research including various stages of connected insulin pens and caps. © 2022 Diabetes Technology Society.},

  abstract={This article maps considerations of inclusiveness and support for students with disabilities by reviewing articles within the field of learning analytics. The study involved a PRISMA-informed systematic review of two popular digital libraries, namely Clarivate’s Web of Science, and Elsevier’s Scopus for peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings. A final corpus of 26 articles was analysed. Findings show that although the field of learning analytics emerged in 2011, none of the studies identified here covered topics of inclusiveness in education before the year of 2016. Screening also shows that learning analytics provides great potential to promote inclusiveness in terms of reducing discrimination, increasing retention among disadvantaged students, and validating particular learning designs for marginalised groups. Gaps in this potential are also identified. The article aims to provide valuable insight into what is known about learning analytics and inclusiveness and contribute knowledge to this particular nascent area for researchers and institutional stakeholders. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background: Environmental exposures are implicated in diabetes etiology, but are poorly understood due to disease heterogeneity, complexity of exposures, and analytical challenges. Machine learning and data mining are artificial intelligence methods that can address these limitations. Despite their increasing adoption in etiology and prediction of diabetes research, the types of methods and exposures analyzed have not been thoroughly reviewed. Objective: We aimed to review articles that implemented machine learning and data mining methods to understand environmental exposures in diabetes etiology and disease prediction. Methods: We queried PubMed and Scopus databases for machine learning and data mining studies that used environmental exposures to understand diabetes etiology on September 19th, 2022. Exposures were classified into specific external, general external, or internal exposures. We reviewed machine learning and data mining methods and characterized the scope of environmental exposures studied in the etiology of general diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other types of diabetes. Results: We identified 44 articles for inclusion. Specific external exposures were the most common exposures studied, and supervised models were the most common methods used. Well-established specific external exposures of low physical activity, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides were predictive of general diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and prediabetes, while novel metabolic and gut microbiome biomarkers were implicated in type 1 diabetes. Discussion: The use of machine learning and data mining methods to elucidate environmental triggers of diabetes was largely limited to well-established risk factors identified using easily explainable and interpretable models. Future studies should seek to leverage machine learning and data mining to explore the temporality and co-occurrence of multiple exposures and further evaluate the role of general external and internal exposures in diabetes etiology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Student engagement has been identified as a critical construct for understanding and predicting educational success. However, research has shown that it can be hard to align data-driven insights of engagement with observed and self-reported levels of engagement. Given the emergence and increasing application of learning analytics (LA) within K-12 education, further research is needed to understand how engagement is being conceptualized and measured within LA research. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes literature published between 2011-2022, focused on LA and student engagement in K-12 contexts, and indexed in five international databases. 27 articles and conference papers from 13 different countries were included for review. We found that most of the research was undertaken in middle school years within STEM subjects. The results show that there is a wide discrepancy in researchers' understanding and operationalization of engagement and little evidence to suggest that LA improves learning outcomes and support. However, the potential to do so remains strong. Guidance is provided for future LA engagement research to better align with these goals.  © 2023 ACM.},

  abstract={Introduction: Artificial intelligence can recognize complex patterns in large datasets. It is a promising technology to advance heart failure practice, as many decisions rely on expert opinions in the absence of high-quality data-driven evidence. Methods: We searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for articles containing “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” or “deep learning” and any of the phrases “heart transplantation,” “ventricular assist device,” or “cardiogenic shock” from inception until August 2022. We only included original research addressing post heart transplantation (HTx) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) clinical care. Review and data extraction were performed in accordance with PRISMA-Scr guidelines. Results: Of 584 unique publications detected, 31 met the inclusion criteria. The majority focused on outcome prediction post HTx (n = 13) and post durable MCS (n = 7), as well as post HTx and MCS management (n = 7, n = 3, respectively). One study addressed temporary mechanical circulatory support. Most studies advocated for rapid integration of AI into clinical practice, acknowledging potential improvements in management guidance and reliability of outcomes prediction. There was a notable paucity of external data validation and integration of multiple data modalities. Conclusion: Our review showed mounting innovation in AI application in management of MCS and HTx, with the largest evidence showing improved mortality outcome prediction.

  abstract={Background: The increasing amount of molecular data and knowledge about genomic alterations from next-generation sequencing processes together allow for a greater understanding of individual patients, thereby advancing precision medicine. Molecular tumour boards feature multidisciplinary teams of clinical experts who meet to discuss complex individual cancer cases. Preparing the meetings is a manual and time-consuming process. Purpose: To design a clinical decision support system to improve the multimodal data interpretation in molecular tumour board meetings for lymphoma patients at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. We investigated user needs and system requirements, explored the employment of artificial intelligence, and evaluated the proposed design with primary stakeholders. Methods: Design science methodology was used to form and evaluate the proposed artefact. Requirements elicitation was done through a scoping review followed by five semi-structured interviews. We used UML Use Case diagrams to model user interaction and UML Activity diagrams to inform the proposed flow of control in the system. Additionally, we modelled the current and future workflow for MTB meetings and its proposed machine learning pipeline. Interactive sessions with end-users validated the initial requirements based on a fictive patient scenario which helped further refine the system. Results: The analysis showed that an interactive secure Web-based information system supporting the preparation of the meeting, multidisciplinary discussions, and clinical decision-making could address the identified requirements. Integrating artificial intelligence via continual learning and multimodal data fusion were identified as crucial elements that could provide accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Impact: Our work is of methodological importance in that using artificial intelligence for molecular tumour boards is novel. We provide a consolidated proof-of-concept system that could support the end-to-end clinical decision-making process and positively and immediately impact patients. Conclusion: Augmenting a digital decision support system for molecular tumour boards with retrospective patient material is promising. This generates realistic and constructive material for human learning, and also digital data for continual learning by data-driven artificial intelligence approaches. The latter makes the future system adaptable to human bias, improving adequacy and decision quality over time and over tasks, while building and maintaining a digital log.

  abstract={Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating, gynecologic condition with a non-specific clinical presentation. Globally, patients can experience diagnostic delays of ~6 to 12 years, which significantly hinders adequate management and places a significant financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. Through artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to create models that can extract data patterns to act as inputs for developing interventions with predictive and diagnostic accuracies that are superior to conventional methods and current tools used in standards of care. This literature review explored the use of AI methods to address different clinical problems in endometriosis. Approximately 1309 unique records were found across four databases; among those, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they involved an AI approach or model to explore endometriosis pathology, diagnostics, prediction, or management and if they reported evaluation metrics (sensitivity and specificity) after validating their models. Only articles accessible in English were included in this review. Logistic regression was the most popular machine learning method, followed by decision tree algorithms, random forest, and support vector machines. Approximately 44.4% (n = 16) of the studies analyzed the predictive capabilities of AI approaches in patients with endometriosis, while 47.2% (n = 17) explored diagnostic capabilities, and 8.33% (n = 3) used AI to improve disease understanding. Models were built using different data types, including biomarkers, clinical variables, metabolite spectra, genetic variables, imaging data, mixed methods, and lesion characteristics. Regardless of the AI-based endometriosis application (either diagnostic or predictive), pooled sensitivities ranged from 81.7 to 96.7%, and pooled specificities ranged between 70.7 and 91.6%. Overall, AI models displayed good diagnostic and predictive capacity in detecting endometriosis using simple classification scenarios (i.e., differentiating between cases and controls), showing promising directions for AI in assessing endometriosis in the near future. This timely review highlighted an emerging area of interest in endometriosis and AI. It also provided recommendations for future research in this field to improve the reproducibility of results and comparability between models, and further test the capacity of these models to enhance diagnosis, prediction, and management in endometriosis patients. © 2022, Crown.},

  abstract={Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with morbidity and mortality in a wide range of surgical settings. Nowadays, with the increasing use of electronic health records (EHR), advances in patient information retrieval, and cost reduction in clinical informatics, artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve early recognition and management for perioperative AKI. However, there is no quantitative synthesis of the performance of these methods. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of artificial intelligence for the prediction of acute kidney injury during the perioperative period. Methods: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched to 2nd October 2021. Studies presenting diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in the early detection of perioperative acute kidney injury were included. True positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives were pooled to collate specificity and sensitivity with 95% CIs and results were portrayed in forest plots. The risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool. Results: Nineteen studies involving 304,076 patients were included. Quantitative random-effects meta-analysis using the Rutter and Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model revealed pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.81),0.75 (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.80), and 10.7 (95% CI 8.5 to 13.5), respectively. Threshold effect was found to be the only source of heterogeneity, and there was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Our review demonstrates the promising performance of artificial intelligence for early prediction of perioperative AKI. The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only at a single center should be overcome.

  abstract={Background: Global public health action to address noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) requires new approaches. NCDs are primarily prevented and managed in the community where there is little investment in digital health systems and analytics; this has created a data chasm and relatively silent burden of disease. The nascent but rapidly emerging area of precision public health offers exciting new opportunities to transform our approach to NCD prevention. Precision public health uses routinely collected real-world data on determinants of health (social, environmental, behavioural, biomedical and commercial) to inform precision decision-making, interventions and policy based on social position, equity and disease risk, and continuously monitors outcomes – the right intervention for the right population at the right time. This scoping review aims to identify global exemplars of precision public health and the data sources and methods of their aggregation/application to NCD prevention. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was followed. Six databases were systematically searched for articles published until February 2021. Articles were included if they described digital aggregation of real-world data and ‘traditional’ data for applied community, population or public health management of NCDs. Real-world data was defined as routinely collected (1) Clinical, Medication and Family History (2) Claims/Billing (3) Mobile Health (4) Environmental (5) Social media (6) Molecular profiling (7) Patient-centred (e.g., personal health record). Results were analysed descriptively and mapped according to the three horizons framework for digital health transformation. Results: Six studies were included. Studies developed population health surveillance methods and tools using diverse real-world data (e.g., electronic health records and health insurance providers) and traditional data (e.g., Census and administrative databases) for precision surveillance of 28 NCDs. Population health analytics were applied consistently with descriptive, geospatial and temporal functions. Evidence of using surveillance tools to create precision public health models of care or improve policy and practice decisions was unclear. Conclusions: Applications of real-world data and designed data to address NCDs are emerging with greater precision. Digital transformation of the public health sector must be accelerated to create an efficient and sustainable predict-prevent healthcare system. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Purpose of Review: To present an overview of registry-based anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) research, as well as provide insight into the future of ACL registries. Recent Findings: During the past decades, the ACL registries have had an important role in increasing our understanding of patients with ACL injuries and their treatment. The registry data has deepened our understanding of factors that have been associated with an increased risk of sustaining an ACL injury and for evaluation of treatment factors and their impact on patient-related outcomes. Recently, registry-based ACL research using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown potential to create clinical decision-making tools and analyzing outcomes. Thus, standardization of collected data between the registries is needed to facilitate the further collaboration between registries and to facilitate the interpretation of results and subsequently improve the possibilities for implementation of AI and ML in the registry-based research. Summary: Several studies have been based on the current ACL registries providing an insight into the epidemiology of ACL injuries as well as outcomes following ACL reconstruction. However, the current ACL registries are facing future challenges, and thus, new methods and techniques are needed to ensure further good quality and clinical applicability of study findings based on ACL registry data. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The objectives of the study were to identify the relationship between big data analytics with context-based news detection on digital media in the data age, to find out the trending approaches to detect fake news on digital media, and to explore the challenges for constructing quality big data to detect misinformation on social media. Scoping review methodology was applied to carry out a content analysis of 42 peer-reviewed research papers published in 10 world-leading digital databases. Findings revealed a strong positive correlation between quality big data analytics and fake news detection on digital media. Additionally, it was found that artificial intelligence, fact-checking sites, neural networks, and new media literacy are trending techniques to identify correct information in the age of misinformation. Moreover, results manifested that hidden agenda, the volume of fake information on digital media, massive unstructured data, the fast spread of fake news on digital media, and fake user accounts are prevalent challenges to construct authentic big data for detecting false online information on digital media platforms. Theoretically, the study has added valuable literature to the existing body of knowledge by exploring the relationship between big data analytics and context-based fake news on digital media in the data age. This intellectual piece also contributes socially by offering practical recommendations to control the cancer of fake news in society for stopping horrific perils; hence, it has a societal impact. Current research has practical applications for generators of digital media applications, policy-makers, decision-takers, government representatives, civil societies, higher education bodies, media workforce, educationists, and all other stakeholders. Recommendations offered in the paper are a roadmap for framing impactful policies to stay away from the harms of fake digital news. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={To enhance the treatment of motor function impairment, patients’ brain signals for self-control as an external tool may be an extraordinarily hopeful option. For the past 10 years, researchers and clinicians in the brain–computer interface (BCI) field have been using movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) as a control signal in neurorehabilitation applications to induce plasticity by monitoring the intention of action and feedback. Here, we reviewed the research on robot therapy (RT) and virtual reality (VR)-MRCP-based BCI rehabilitation technologies as recent advancements in human healthcare. A list of 18 full-text studies suitable for qualitative review out of 322 articles published between 2000 and 2022 was identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used PRISMA guidelines for the systematic review, while the PEDro scale was used for quality evaluation. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the VOSviewer software to identify the relationship and trends of key items. In this review, 4 studies used VR-MRCP, while 14 used RT-MRCP-based BCI neurorehabilitation approaches. The total number of subjects in all identified studies was 107, whereby 4.375 ± 6.3627 were patient subjects and 6.5455 ± 3.0855 were healthy subjects. The type of electrodes, the epoch, classifiers, and the performance information that are being used in the RT- and VR-MRCP-based BCI rehabilitation application are provided in this review. Furthermore, this review also describes the challenges facing this field, solutions, and future directions of these smart human health rehabilitation technologies. By key items relationship and trends analysis, we found that motor control, rehabilitation, and upper limb are important key items in the MRCP-based BCI field. Despite the potential of these rehabilitation technologies, there is a great scarcity of literature related to RT and VR-MRCP-based BCI. However, the information on these rehabilitation methods can be beneficial in developing RT and VR-MRCP-based BCI rehabilitation devices to induce brain plasticity and restore motor impairment. Therefore, this review will provide the basis and references of the MRCP-based BCI used in rehabilitation applications for further clinical and research development. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={While learning analytics (LA) has been highlighted as a field aiming to address systemic equity and quality issues within educational systems between and within regions, to date, its adoption is predominantly in the Global North. Since the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) aspires to be international in reach and relevance, and to increase the diversity and inclusivity of the SoLAR community, it is pertinent to look at learning analytics use in higher education institutions in Africa. This paper reports the first scoping review of research in the field of LA conducted on the African continent. The coding and analysis show that LA research is still in its infancy on the African continent with only 15 studies, overwhelmingly from South Africa. The study also revealed several challenges, such as limited technical support and access to LMSs, the limited visibility of African scholars at SoLAR events and publication venues, and the limited focus on interventions that involve stakeholders. The article concludes with several propositions and provocations to advance the adoption of LA in Africa and open up space for critical conversations about the potential of learning analytics in contexts with characteristics different than those found in the Global North. © 2022, Society for Learning Analytics Research.

This narrative review gives, in the first part, a brief overview of the methods of ML and AI used in patient blood management (PBM) and, in the second part, aims at describing which fields have been analyzed using these methods so far. A total of 442 articles were identified by a literature search, and 47 of them were judged as qualified articles that applied ML and AI techniques in PBM. We assembled the eligible articles to provide insights into the areas of application, quality measures of these studies, and treatment outcomes that can pave the way for further adoption of this promising technology and its possible use in routine clinical decision making. The topics that have been investigated most often were the prediction of transfusion (30%), bleeding (28%), and laboratory studies (15%). Although in the last 3 years a constantly increasing number of questions of ML in PBM have been investigated, there is a vast scientific potential for further application of ML and AI in other fields of PBM. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

  abstract={Cardiac arrhythmias are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden on the health care system. Detection and surveillance of cardiac arrhythmias using medical grade non-invasive methods (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring) is the accepted standard of care. Whilst their accuracy is excellent, significant limitations remain in terms of accessibility, ease of use, cost, and a suboptimal diagnostic yield (up to ∼50%) which is critically dependent on the duration of monitoring. Contemporary wearable and handheld devices that utilise photoplethysmography and the electrocardiogram present a novel opportunity for remote screening and diagnosis of arrhythmias. They have significant advantages in terms of accessibility and availability with the potential of enhancing the diagnostic yield of episodic arrhythmias. However, there is limited data on the accuracy and diagnostic utility of these devices and their role in therapeutic decision making in clinical practice remains unclear. Evidence is mounting that they may be useful in screening for atrial fibrillation, and anecdotally, for the diagnosis of other brady and tachyarrhythmias. Recently, there has been an explosion of patient uptake of such devices for self-monitoring of arrhythmias. Frequently, the clinician is presented such information for review and comment, which may influence clinical decisions about treatment. Further studies are needed before incorporation of such technologies in routine clinical practice, given the lack of systematic data on their accuracy and utility. Moreover, challenges with regulation of quality standards and privacy remain. This state-of-the-art review summarises the role of novel ambulatory, commercially available, heart rhythm monitors in the diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias and their expanding role in the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm in cardiology. © 2022 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)},

  abstract={Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–based tools in the care of individual patients and patient populations is rapidly expanding. Objective: The aim of this paper is to systematically identify research on provider competencies needed for the use of AI in clinical settings. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to identify articles published between January 1, 2009, and May 1, 2020, from MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases, using search queries for terms related to health care professionals (eg, medical, nursing, and pharmacy) and their professional development in all phases of clinical education, AI-based tools in all settings of clinical practice, and professional education domains of competencies and performance. Limits were provided for English language, studies on humans with abstracts, and settings in the United States. Results: The searches identified 3476 records, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. These studies described the use of AI in clinical practice and measured at least one aspect of clinician competence. While many studies measured the performance of the AI-based tool, only 4 measured clinician performance in terms of the knowledge, skills, or attitudes needed to understand and effectively use the new tools being tested. These 4 articles primarily focused on the ability of AI to enhance patient care and clinical decision-making by improving information flow and display, specifically for physicians. Conclusions: While many research studies were identified that investigate the potential effectiveness of using AI technologies in health care, very few address specific competencies that are needed by clinicians to use them effectively.

  abstract={Background: As the uptake of health information technologies increased, most healthcare organizations have become producers of big data. A growing number of hospitals are investing in the development of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities. If the promises associated with these capabilities are high, how hospitals create value from it remains unclear. The present study undertakes a scoping review of existing research on BDA use in hospitals to describe the path from BDA capabilities (BDAC) to value and its associated challenges. Methods: This scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s 5 stages framework. A systematic search strategy was adopted to identify relevant articles in Scopus and Web of Science. Data charting and extraction were performed following an analytical framework that builds on the resource-based view of the firm to describe the path from BDA capabilities to value in hospitals. Results: Of 1,478 articles identified, 94 were included. Most of them are experimental research (n=69) published in medical (n=66) or computer science journals (n=28). The main value targets associated with the use of BDA are improving the quality of decision-making (n=56) and driving innovation (n=52) which apply mainly to care (n=67) and administrative (n=48) activities. To reach these targets, hospitals need to adequately combine BDA capabilities and value creation mechanisms (VCM) to enable knowledge generation and drive its assimilation. Benefits are endpoints of the value creation process. They are expected in all articles but realized in a few instances only (n=19). Conclusions: This review confirms the value creation potential of BDA solutions in hospitals. It also shows the organizational challenges that prevent hospitals from generating actual benefits from BDAC-building efforts. The configuring of strategies, technologies and organizational capabilities underlying the development of value-creating BDA solutions should become a priority area for research, with focus on the mechanisms that can drive the alignment of BDA and organizational strategies, and the development of organizational capabilities to support knowledge generation and assimilation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background Seamless data integration between point-of-care medical devices and the electronic health record (EHR) can be central to clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Objective The objective of this scoping review is to (1) examine the existing evidence related to integrated medical devices, primarily medication pump devices, and associated clinical decision support (CDS) in acute care settings and (2) to identify how acute care clinicians may use device CDS in clinical decision-making. The rationale for this review is that integrated devices are ubiquitous in the acute care setting, and they generate data that may help to contribute to the situational awareness of the clinical team necessary to provide individualized patient care. Methods This scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extensions for Scoping Review guidelines. PubMed, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases were searched for scholarly, peer-reviewed journals indexed between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. A priori inclusion criteria were established. Results Of the 1,924 articles screened, 18 were ultimately included for synthesis, and primarily included articles on devices such as intravenous medication pumps and vital signs machines. Clinical alarm burden was mentioned in most of the articles, and despite not including the term medication there were many articles about smart pumps being integrated with the EHR. The Revised Technology, Nursing & Patient Safety Conceptual Model provided the organizational framework. Ten articles described patient assessment, monitoring, or surveillance use. Three articles described patient protection from harm. Four articles described direct care use scenarios, all of which described insulin administration. One article described a hybrid situation of patient communication and monitoring. Most of the articles described devices and decision support primarily used by registered nurses (RNs). Conclusion The articles in this review discussed devices and the associated CDSS that are used by clinicians, primarily RNs, in the daily provision of care for patients. Integrated device data provide insight into user-device interactions and help to illustrate health care processes, especially the activities when providing direct care to patients in an acute care setting. While there are CDSS designed to support the clinician while working with devices, RNs and providers may disregard this guidance, and defer to their own expertise. Additionally, if clinicians perceive CDSS as intrusive, they are at risk for alarm and alert fatigue if CDSS are not tailored to sync with the workflow of the end-user. Areas for future research include refining inclusion criteria to examine the evidence for devices and their CDS that are most likely used by other groups' health care professionals (i.e., doctors and therapists), using integrated device metadata and deep learning analytics to identify patterns in care delivery, and decision support tools for patients using their own personal data. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

  abstract={Background: Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a common name for various artificial intelligence (AI)-infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions toward the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models used, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work. Objective: This study aimed to provide a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyzed specific AI models used in AÀL systems, the target domains of the models, the technology using the models, and the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal was to consolidate research on this topic and inform end users, health care professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems. Methods: This study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze, and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. Relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. This review included 5 digital libraries: IEEE, PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and MDPI. Results: We included a total of 108 articles. The annual distribution of relevant articles showed a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to July 2022. The AI models mainly used unsupervised and semisupervised approaches. The leading models are deep learning, natural language processing, instance-based learning, and clustering. Activity assistance and recognition were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, mobile technology, and robotic devices mainly implemented the models. Older adults were the primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern. Conclusions: This study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should involve health care professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulations, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with health care technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.  © 2022 Mladjan Jovanovic.},

  abstract={Purpose: This research analyzed the existing academic and grey literature concerning the technologies and practices of people analytics (PA), to understand how ethical considerations are being discussed by researchers, industry experts and practitioners, and to identify gaps, priorities and recommendations for ethical practice. Design/methodology/approach: An iterative “scoping review” method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings: Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to “be ethical,” overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications: This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications: The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value: By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations. It is also timely, given the increase in digital monitoring of employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, Aizhan Tursunbayeva, Claudia Pagliari, Stefano Di Lauro and Gilda Antonelli.},

  abstract={Polypharmacy, the consuming of more than five drugs, is a public health problem. It can lead to many interactions and adverse drug reactions and is very expensive. Therapeutic guidelines for managing polypharmacy in the elderly have been issued, but are highly complex, limiting their use. Decision-support systems have therefore been developed to automate the execution of these guidelines, or to provide information about drugs adapted to the context of polypharmacy. These systems differ widely in terms of their technical design, knowledge sources and evaluation methods. We present here a scoping review of electronic systems for supporting the management, by healthcare providers, of polypharmacy in elderly patients. Most existing reviews have focused mainly on evaluation results, whereas the present review also describes the technical design of these systems and the methodologies for developing and evaluating them. A systematic bibliographic search identified 19 systems differing considerably in terms of their technical design (rule-based systems, documentary approach, mixed); outputs (textual report, alerts and/or visual approaches); and evaluations (impact on clinical practices, impact on patient outcomes, efficiency and/or user satisfaction). The evaluations performed are minimal (among all the systems identified, only one system has been evaluated according to all the criteria mentioned above) and no machine learning systems and/or conflict management systems were retrieved. This review highlights the need to develop new methodologies, combining various approaches for decision support system in polypharmacy. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Physiological Closed-Loop Controlled systems continue to take a growing part in clinical practice, offering possibilities of providing more accurate, goal-directed care while reducing clinicians’ cognitive and task load. These systems also provide a standardized approach for the clinical management of the patient, leading to a reduction in care variability across multiple dimensions. For fluid management and administration, the advantages of closed-loop technology are clear, especially in conditions that require precise care to improve outcomes, such as peri-operative care, trauma, and acute burn care. Controller design varies from simplistic to complex designs, based on detailed physiological models and adaptive properties that account for inter-patient and intra-patient variability; their maturity level ranges from theoretical models tested in silico to commercially available, FDA-approved products. This comprehensive scoping review was conducted in order to assess the current technological landscape of this field, describe the systems currently available or under development, and suggest further advancements that may unfold in the coming years.

  abstract={Introduction: The ongoing collection of large medical data has created conditions for application of artificial intelligence (AI) in research. This scoping review aimed to identify major areas of interest of AI applied to health care administrative data. Methods: The search was performed in seven databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of science, IEEE, ICM digital library, and Compendex. We included articles published between January 2001 and March 2021, that described research with AI applied to medical diagnostics, pharmacotherapy, and health outcomes data. We screened the full text content and used natural language processing to automatically extract health areas of interest, principal AI methods, and names of medications. Results: Out of 14,864 articles, 343 were included. We determined ten areas of interest, the most common being health diagnostic or treatment outcome prediction (32%); representation of medical data, clinical pathways, and data temporality (i.e., transformation of raw medical data into compact and analysis-friendly format) (22%); and adverse drug effects, drug-drug interactions, and medication cascades (15%). Less attention has been devoted to areas such as health effects of polypharmacy (1%); and reinforcement learning (1%). The most common AI methods were decision trees, cluster analysis, random forests, and support vector machines. Most frequently mentioned medications included insulin, metformin, vitamins, acetaminophen, and heparin. Conclusions: The scoping review revealed the potential of AI application to health-related studies. However, several areas of interest in pharmacoepidemiology are sparsely reported, and the lack of details in studies related to pharmacotherapy suggests that AI could be used more optimally in pharmacoepidemiologic research.

  abstract={Artificial and augmented intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are expanding into the health care space. Big data are increasingly used in patient care applications, diagnostics, and treatment decisions in allergy and immunology. How these technologies will be evaluated, approved, and assessed for their impact is an important consideration for researchers and practitioners alike. With the potential of ML, deep learning, natural language processing, and other assistive methods to redefine health care usage, a scaffold for the impact of AI technology on research and patient care in allergy and immunology is needed. An American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology Health Information Technology and Education subcommittee workgroup was convened to perform a scoping review of AI within health care as well as the specialty of allergy and immunology to address impacts on allergy and immunology practice and research as well as potential challenges including education, AI governance, ethical and equity considerations, and potential opportunities for the specialty. There are numerous potential clinical applications of AI in allergy and immunology that range from disease diagnosis to multidimensional data reduction in electronic health records or immunologic datasets. For appropriate application and interpretation of AI, specialists should be involved in the design, validation, and implementation of AI in allergy and immunology. Challenges include incorporation of data science and bioinformatics into training of future allergists-immunologists. © 2022},

  abstract={Objective To provide a review of prediction models that have been used to measure clinical or pathological progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design Scoping review. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus from the year 2011 to 17th February 2022. Study selection All English written studies that are published in peer-reviewed journals in any country, that developed at least a statistical or computational model that predicted the risk of CKD progression. Data extraction Eligible studies for full text review were assessed on the methods that were used to predict the progression of CKD. The type of information extracted included: the author(s), title of article, year of publication, study dates, study location, number of participants, study design, predicted outcomes, type of prediction model, prediction variables used, validation assessment, limitations and implications. Results From 516 studies, 33 were included for full-text review. A qualitative analysis of the articles was compared following the extracted information. The study populations across the studies were heterogenous and data acquired by the studies were sourced from different levels and locations of healthcare systems. 31 studies implemented supervised models, and 2 studies included unsupervised models. Regardless of the model used, the predicted outcome included measurement of risk of progression towards end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) of related definitions, over given time intervals. However, there is a lack of reporting consistency on details of the development of their prediction models. Conclusions Researchers are working towards producing an effective model to provide key insights into the progression of CKD. This review found that cox regression modelling was predominantly used among the small number of studies in the review. This made it difficult to perform a comparison between ML algorithms, more so when different validation methods were used in different cohort types. There needs to be increased investment in a more consistent and reproducible approach for future studies looking to develop risk prediction models for CKD progression. © 2022 Lim et al.

  abstract={Background: Prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased over the last few decades with 1.5 million deaths reported in 2012 alone. Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective: This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results: From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions: This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in various fields of medicine. It has the potential to facilitate shared decision making (SDM). However, there is no comprehensive mapping of how AI may be used for SDM. Objective: We aimed to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI to facilitate SDM. Methods: We performed a scoping review informed by the methodological framework proposed by Levac et al, modifications to the original Arksey and O'Malley framework of a scoping review, and the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review framework. We reported our results based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) reporting guideline. At the identification stage, an information specialist performed a comprehensive search of 6 electronic databases from their inception to May 2021. The inclusion criteria were: all populations; all AI interventions that were used to facilitate SDM, and if the AI intervention was not used for the decision-making point in SDM, it was excluded; any outcome related to patients, health care providers, or health care systems; studies in any health care setting, only studies published in the English language, and all study types. Overall, 2 reviewers independently performed the study selection process and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: The search process yielded 1445 records. After removing duplicates, 894 documents were screened, and 6 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion criteria. Overall, 2 of them were conducted in North America, 2 in Europe, 1 in Australia, and 1 in Asia. Most articles were published after 2017. Overall, 3 articles focused on primary care, and 3 articles focused on secondary care. All studies used machine learning methods. Moreover, 3 articles included health care providers in the validation stage of the AI intervention, and 1 article included both health care providers and patients in clinical validation, but none of the articles included health care providers or patients in the design and development of the AI intervention. All used AI to support SDM by providing clinical recommendations or predictions. Conclusions: Evidence of the use of AI in SDM is in its infancy. We found AI supporting SDM in similar ways across the included articles. We observed a lack of emphasis on patients' values and preferences, as well as poor reporting of AI interventions, resulting in a lack of clarity about different aspects. Little effort was made to address the topics of explainability of AI interventions and to include end-users in the design and development of the interventions. Further efforts are required to strengthen and standardize the use of AI in different steps of SDM and to evaluate its impact on various decisions, populations, and settings. ©Samira Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi, Michelle Cwintal, Yuhui Huang, Pooria Ghadiri, Roland Grad, Dan Poenaru, Genevieve Gore, Hervé Tchala Vignon Zomahoun, France Légaré, Pierre Pluye.

  abstract={The technological advancements in the field of medical science have led to an escalation in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which are being extensively used in health sciences. This scoping review aims to outline the application and performance of artificial intelligence models used for diagnosing, treatment planning and predicting the prognosis of orthognathic surgery (OGS). Data for this paper was searched through renowned electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of science, Embase and Cochrane for articles related to the research topic that have been published between January 2000 and February 2022. Eighteen articles that met the eligibility criteria were critically analyzed based on QUADAS-2 guidelines and the certainty of evidence of the included studies was assessed using the GRADE approach. AI has been applied for predicting the post-operative facial profiles and facial symmetry, deciding on the need for OGS, predicting perioperative blood loss, planning OGS, segmentation of maxillofacial structures for OGS, and differential diagnosis of OGS. AI models have proven to be efficient and have outperformed the conventional methods. These models are reported to be reliable and reproducible, hence they can be very useful for less experienced practitioners in clinical decision making and in achieving better clinical outcomes. © 2022 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: There is an increasing interest in using routinely collected eHealth data to support reflective practice and long-term professional learning. Studies have evaluated the impact of dashboards on clinician decision-making, task completion time, user satisfaction, and adherence to clinical guidelines. Objective: This scoping review aims to summarize the literature on dashboards based on patient administrative, medical, and surgical data for clinicians to support reflective practice. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in 5 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Web of Science) to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study selection and characterization were performed by 2 independent reviewers (BB and CP). One reviewer extracted the data that were analyzed descriptively to map the available evidence. Results: A total of 18 dashboards from 8 countries were assessed. Purposes for the dashboards were designed for performance improvement (10/18, 56%), to support quality and safety initiatives (6/18, 33%), and management and operations (4/18, 22%). Data visualizations were primarily designed for team use (12/18, 67%) rather than individual clinicians (4/18, 22%). Evaluation methods varied among asking the clinicians directly (11/18, 61%), observing user behavior through clinical indicators and use log data (14/18, 78%), and usability testing (4/18, 22%). The studies reported high scores on standard usability questionnaires, favorable surveys, and interview feedback. Improvements to underlying clinical indicators were observed in 78% (7/9) of the studies, whereas 22% (2/9) of the studies reported no significant changes in performance. Conclusions: This scoping review maps the current literature landscape on dashboards based on routinely collected clinical indicator data. Although there were common data visualization techniques and clinical indicators used across studies, there was diversity in the design of the dashboards and their evaluation. There was a lack of detail regarding the design processes documented for reproducibility. We identified a lack of interface features to support clinicians in making sense of and reflecting on their personal performance data. © 2022 JMIR Medical Informatics. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Introduction: Health systems in high-income countries face a variety of challenges calling for a systemic approach to improve quality and efficiency. Putting people in the centre is the main idea of the WHO model of people-centred and integrated health services. Integrating health services is fuelled by an integration of health data with great potentials for decision support based on big data analytics. The research question of this paper is “How can big data analytics support people-centred and integrated health services?” Methods: A scoping review following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses – Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted to gather information on how big data analytics can support people-centred and integrated health services. The results were summarized in a role model of a people-centred and integrated health services platform illustrating which data sources might be integrated and which types of analytics might be applied to support the strategies of the people-centred and integrated health services framework to become more integrated across the continuum of care. Additional rapid literature reviews were conducted to generate frequency distributions of the most often used data types and analytical methods in the medical literature. Finally, the main challenges connected with big data analytics were worked out based on a content analysis of the results from the scoping literature review. Results: Based on the results from the rapid literature reviews the most often used data sources for big data analytics (BDA) in healthcare were biomarkers (39.3%) and medical images (30.9%). The most often used analytical models were support vector machines (27.3%) and neural networks (20.4%). The people-centred and integrated health services framework defines different strategic interventions for health services to become more integrated. To support all aspects of these interventions a comparably integrated platform of health-related data would be needed, so that a role model labelled as people-centred health platform was developed. Based on integrated data the results of the scoping review (n = 72) indicate, that big data analytics could for example support the strategic intervention of tailoring personalized health plans (43.1%), e.g. by predicting individual risk factors for different therapy options. Also BDA might enhance clinical decision support tools (31.9%), e.g. by calculating risk factors for disease uptake or progression. BDA might also assist in designing population-based services (26.4% by clustering comparable individuals in manageable risk groups e.g. mentored by specifically trained, non-medical professionals. The main challenges of big data analytics in healthcare were categorized in regulatory, (information-) technological, methodological, and cultural issues, whereas methodological challenges were mentioned most often (55.0%), followed by regulatory challenges (43.7%). Discussion: The BDA applications presented in this literature review are based on findings which have already been published. For some important components of the framework on people-centred care like enhancing the role of community care or establishing intersectoral partnerships between health and social care institutions only few examples of enabling big data analytical tools were found in the literature. Quite the opposite does this mean that these strategies have less potential value, but rather that the source systems in these fields need to be further developed to be suitable for big data analytics. Conclusions: Big data analytics can support people-centred and integrated health services e.g. by patient similarity stratifications or predictions of individual risk factors. But BDA fails to unfold its full potential until data source systems are still disconnected and actions towards a comprehensive and people-centred healthrelated data platform are politically insufficiently incentivized. This work highlighted the potential of big data analysis in the context of the model of people-centred and integrated health services, whereby the role model of the person-centered health platform can be used as a blueprint to support strategies to improve personcentered health care. Likely because health data is extremely sensitive and complex, there are only few practical examples of platforms to some extent already capable of merging and processing people-centred big data, but the integration of health data can be expected to further proceed so that analytical opportunities might also become reality in the near future. © 2022 The Author(s).},

  abstract={The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in its many forms such as machine learning, data mining, learning analytics, etc. is undeniable. It is transforming not only social and economic life, but also education. Thus, the chapter examines the influence of AI on teaching and learning in higher education. For this study, a scoping literature review was conducted to form a narrative overview of artificial intelligence in higher education. The synthesis of the results provides an assembly of key terminology such as machine learning, learning analytics, data mining, etc. as well as application in which these technologies are implemented such as for prediction, automation, etc. Often AI works in the background improving performances and offering advice or recommendations; thus, this pervasive technology becomes invisible to users. Overall, AI can contribute to a positive learning experience and motivation. Considering this digital transformation, competences and skills necessary for students and educators alike are shifting, so that so-called 21s century skills are gaining importance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={Background: There are a host of emergent technologies with the potential to improve hospital care in low- and middle-income countries such as Vietnam. Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting. ©Duc Minh Tran, C Louise Thwaites, Jennifer Ilo Van Nuil, Jacob McKnight, An Phuoc Luu, Chris Paton},

  abstract={Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that causes airflow limitation to the lungs and has a high morbidity around the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied for the management of the disease, analyzing the objectives that are raised, the algorithms that are used and what results they offer. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) guidelines. Two reviewers independently searched, analyzed and extracted data from papers of five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Cochrane. To be included, the studies had to apply some AI techniques for the management of at least one stage of the COPD clinical process. In the event of any discrepancy between both reviewers, the criterion of a third reviewer prevailed. Results: 380 papers were identified through database searches. After applying the exclusion criteria, 67 papers were included in the study. The studies were of a different nature and pursued a wide range of objectives, highlighting mainly those focused on the identification, classification and prevention of the disease. Neural nets, support vector machines and decision trees were the AI algorithms most commonly used. The mean and median values of all the performance metrics evaluated were between 80% and 90%. Conclusions: The results obtained show a growing interest in the development of medical applications that manage the different phases of the COPD clinical process, especially predictive models. According to the performance shown, these models could be a useful complementary tool in the decision-making by health specialists, although more high-quality ML studies are needed to endorse the findings of this study. © 2021},

  abstract={Since its inception in 2011, Learning Analytics has matured and expanded in terms of reach (e.g., primary and K-12 education) and in having access to a greater variety, volume and velocity of data (e.g. collecting and analyzing multimodal data). Its roots in multiple disciplines yield a range and richness of theoretical influences resulting in an inherent theoretical pluralism. Such multi-and interdisciplinary origins and influences raise questions around which learning theories inform learning analytics research, and the implications for the field should a particular theory dominate. In establishing the theoretical influences in learning analytics, this scoping review focused on the Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) Proceedings (2011–2020) and the Journal of Learning Analytics (JLA) (2014–2020) as data sources. While learning analytics research is published across a range of scholarly journals, at the time of this study, a significant part of research into learning analytics had been published under the auspices of the Society of Learning Analytics (SoLAR), in the proceedings of the annual LAK conference and the field’s official journal, and as such, provides particular insight into its theoretical underpinnings. The analysis found evidence of a range of theoretical influences. While some learning theories have waned since 2011, others, such as Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), are in the ascendency. We discuss the implications of the use of learning theory in learning analytics research and conclude that this theoretical pluralism is something to be treasured and protected. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={CONTEXT: Deformational plagiocephaly is a common diagnosis encountered by pediatricians in  the first year of life. Subjective clinical examination and documentation is the most common method for identifying and monitoring the evolution of head shape and determining treatment or the decision to refer to a specialist. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review (PROSPERO; CRD42021224842), we aim to compile the evidence for non-radiographic screening and monitoring modalities for deformational plagiocephaly in infants to support pediatricians in achieving earlier diagnosis and more objective monitoring. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using OVID Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Articles pertaining to the use or evaluation of diagnostic modalities for plagiocephaly in infants published between January 1990 and August 2021. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on diagnostic accuracy, time-to-diagnosis, reliability, and outcomes for each modality were collected as available by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were included. We identified 5 unique head shape monitoring technologies: anthropometry, plagiocephalometry, 3D laser scanning, digital photographic, and 3D photogrammetry. Smartphone and artificial intelligence integration have increased in plagiocephaly and craniosynostosis screening and monitoring tools. LIMITATIONS: Inconsistent reporting both inter- and intra-modality hindered meaningful comparison between screening tools. Substantial heterogeneity in measured outcomes, study design, and population size made cross-study comparisons difficult. CONCLUSIONS: A growing list of quantitative diagnostic modalities for head shape monitoring are becoming accessible to pediatricians. The introduction of artificial intelligence to 3D photogrammetry and digital photography with easy-to-use smartphone applications seems promising for future diagnostic efficiency.

  abstract={Background: Simple visualizations in health research data, such as scatter plots, heat maps, and bar charts, typically present relationships between 2 variables. Interactive visualization methods allow for multiple related facets such as numerous risk factors to be studied simultaneously, leading to data insights through exploring trends and patterns from complex big health care data. The technique presents a powerful tool that can be used in combination with statistical analysis for knowledge discovery, hypothesis generation and testing, and decision support. Objective: The primary objective of this scoping review is to describe and summarize the evidence of interactive visualization applications, methods, and tools being used in population health and health services research (HSR) and their subdomains in the last 15 years, from January 1, 2005, to March 30, 2019. Our secondary objective is to describe the use cases, metrics, frameworks used, settings, target audience, goals, and co-design of applications. Methods: We adapted standard scoping review guidelines with a peer-reviewed search strategy: 2 independent researchers at each stage of screening and abstraction, with a third independent researcher to arbitrate conflicts and validate findings. A comprehensive abstraction platform was built to capture the data from diverse bodies of literature, primarily from the computer science and health care sectors. After screening 11,310 articles, we present findings from 56 applications from interrelated areas of population health and HSR, as well as their subdomains such as epidemiologic surveillance, health resource planning, access, and use and costs among diverse clinical and demographic populations. Results: In this companion review to our earlier systematic synthesis of the literature on visual analytics applications, we present findings in 6 major themes of interactive visualization applications developed for 8 major problem categories. We found a wide application of interactive visualization methods, the major ones being epidemiologic surveillance for infectious disease, resource planning, health service monitoring and quality, and studying medication use patterns. The data sources included mostly secondary administrative and electronic medical record data. In addition, at least two-thirds of the applications involved participatory co-design approaches while introducing a distinct category, embedded research, within co-design initiatives. These applications were in response to an identified need for data-driven insights into knowledge generation and decision support. We further discuss the opportunities stemming from the use of interactive visualization methods in studying global health; inequities, including social determinants of health; and other related areas. We also allude to the challenges in the uptake of these methods. Conclusions: Visualization in health has strong historical roots, with an upward trend in the use of these methods in population health and HSR. Such applications are being fast used by academic and health care agencies for knowledge discovery, hypotheses generation, and decision support. ©Jawad Chishtie, Iwona Anna Bielska, Aldo Barrera, Jean-Sebastien Marchand, Muhammad Imran, Syed Farhan Ali Tirmizi, Luke A Turcotte, Sarah Munce, John Shepherd, Arrani Senthinathan, Monica Cepoiu-Martin, Michael Irvine, Jessica Babineau, Sally Abudiab, Marko Bjelica, Christopher Collins, B Catharine Craven, Sara Guilcher, Tara Jeji, Parisa Naraei, Susan Jaglal.},

  abstract={The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare services, faced with the twin challenges in acutely meeting the medical needs of patients with COVID-19 while continuing essential services for non-COVID-19 illnesses. The need to re-invent, re-organize and transform healthcare and co-ordinate clinical services at a population level is urgent as countries that controlled initial outbreaks start to experience resurgences. A wide range of digital health solutions have been proposed, although the extent of successful real-world applications of these technologies is unclear. This study aims to review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, and other relevant digital health solutions for public health responses in the healthcare operating environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic scoping review was performed to identify potentially relevant reports. Key findings include a large body of evidence for various clinical and operational applications of telehealth (40.1%, n = 99/247). Although a large quantity of reports investigated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) (44.9%, n = 111/247) and big data analytics (36.0%, n = 89/247), weaknesses in study design limit generalizability and translation, highlighting the need for more pragmatic real-world investigations. There were also few descriptions of applications for the internet of things (IoT) (2.0%, n = 5/247), digital platforms for communication (DC) (10.9%, 27/247), digital solutions for data management (DM) (1.6%, n = 4/247), and digital structural screening (DS) (8.9%, n = 22/247); representing gaps and opportunities for digital public health. Finally, the performance of digital health technology for operational applications related to population surveillance and points of entry have not been adequately evaluated. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background Acute coronary syndrome is the topmost cause of death worldwide; therefore, it is necessary to predict major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular deaths in patients with acute coronary syndrome to make correct and timely clinical decisions. Objective The current review aimed to highlight algorithms and important predictor variables through examining those studies which used machine learning algorithms for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods To predict major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, the preferred reporting items for scoping reviews guidelines were used. In doing so, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Springer, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for articles published between 2005 and 2021. The checklist Quality assessment of machine learning studies was used to assess the quality of eligible studies. The findings of the studies are presented in the form of a narrative synthesis of evidence. Results In total, among 2,558 retrieved articles, 22 studies were qualified for analysis. Major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality were predicted in 5 and 17 studies, respectively. According to the results, 14 (63.64%) studies did not perform external validation and only used registry data. The algorithms used in this study comprised, inter alia, Regression Logistic, Random Forest, Boosting Ensemble, Non-Boosting Ensemble, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. Multiple studies (N = 20) achieved a high area under the ROC curve between 0.8 and 0.99 in predicting mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. The predictor variables used in these studies were divided into demographic, clinical, and therapeutic features. However, no study reported the integration of machine learning model into clinical practice. Conclusion Machine learning algorithms rendered acceptable results to predict major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, these approaches have never been integrated into clinical practice. Further research is required to develop feasible and effective machine learning prediction models to measure their potentially important implications for optimizing the quality of care in patients with acute coronary syndrome.  © 2022.

  abstract={Aging refers to progressive physiological changes in a cell, an organ, or the whole body of an individual, over time. Aging-related diseases are highly prevalent and could impact an individual’s physical health. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been used to predict aging-related diseases and issues, aiding clinical providers in decision-making based on patient’s medical records. Deep learning (DL), as one of the most recent generations of AI technologies, has embraced rapid progress in the early prediction and classification of aging-related issues. In this paper, a scoping review of publications using DL approaches to predict common aging-related diseases (such as age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, arthritis, Alzheimer’s and lifestyle patterns related to disease progression), is performed. Google Scholar, IEEE and PubMed are used to search DL papers on common aging-related issues published between January 2017 and August 2021. These papers are reviewed, evaluated, and the findings are summarized. Overall, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies indicate that DL could help clinicians in diagnosing disease at its early stages by mapping diagnostic predictions into observable clinical presentations; and achieving high predictive performance (e.g., more than 90% accurate predictions of diseases in aging). © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={The number of inherited heart disease (IHD) studies using artificial intelligence (AI) has increased rapidly over the last years. In this scoping review, we aimed to present an overview of the current literature available on the applicability of AI within the field of IHD. The literature search resulted in eighteen articles in which an AI model was trained and tested, mostly for diagnostic and predictive purposes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.78-0.96, but varied between IHD types, used methods and outcome measures. Only three out of eighteen did perform validation on an external dataset and most studies did not use explainable deep learning models. To be able to integrate AI as a tool to aid physicians in their diagnoses and clinical decisions within the IHD field, generalizability has to be better evaluated and explainability of DL models has to be increased. © 2022},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can contribute to the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in the literature on AI techniques for prostate cancer diagnosis. This review article presents a summary of the AI methods that detect and diagnose prostate cancer using different medical imaging modalities. Following the PRISMA-ScR principle, this review covers 69 studies selected from 1441 searched papers published in the last three years. The application of AI methods reported in these articles can be divided into three broad categories: diagnosis, grading, and segmentation of tissues that have prostate cancer. Most of the AI methods leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their ability to extract complex features. Some studies also reported traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), decision trees for classification, LASSO, and Ridge regression methods for features extraction. We believe that the implementation of AI-based tools will support clinicians to provide better diagnosis plans for prostate cancer.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

The review examined 37 peer-reviewed journal articles published from 2016 to 2020 from six databases. Results show that most studies were guided by the theories of self-regulated learning and social constructivism; most integrated theories into LA for better interpreting the data analysis results; and most linked theoretical constructs and log variables directly. Several studies employed well-developed survey instruments to measure theoretical constructs. The review results indicate that LA studies still need to strive for new theory advances in learning.

  abstract={Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is the 10th most common cause of frailty in young individuals and has triggered morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients with BD have a life expectancy 9 to 17 years lower than that of normal people. BD is a predominant mental disorder, but it can be misdiagnosed as depressive disorder, which leads to difficulties in treating affected patients. Approximately 60% of patients with BD are treated for depression. However, machine learning provides advanced skills and techniques for better diagnosis of BD. Objective: This review aims to explore the machine learning algorithms used for the detection and diagnosis of bipolar disorder and its subtypes. Methods: The study protocol adopted the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We explored 3 databases, namely Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. To enhance the search, we performed backward screening of all the references of the included studies. Based on the predefined selection criteria, 2 levels of screening were performed: title and abstract review, and full review of the articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed independently by all investigators. To synthesize the extracted data, a narrative synthesis approach was followed. Results: We retrieved 573 potential articles were from the 3 databases. After preprocessing and screening, only 33 articles that met our inclusion criteria were identified. The most commonly used data belonged to the clinical category (19, 58%). We identified different machine learning models used in the selected studies, including classification models (18, 55%), regression models (5, 16%), model-based clustering methods (2, 6%), natural language processing (1, 3%), clustering algorithms (1, 3%), and deep learning-based models (3, 9%). Magnetic resonance imaging data were most commonly used for classifying bipolar patients compared to other groups (11, 34%), whereas microarray expression data sets and genomic data were the least commonly used. The maximum ratio of accuracy was 98%, whereas the minimum accuracy range was 64%. Conclusions: This scoping review provides an overview of recent studies based on machine learning models used to diagnose patients with BD regardless of their demographics or if they were compared to patients with psychiatric diagnoses. Further research can be conducted to provide clinical decision support in the health industry. © Zainab Jan, Noor AI-Ansari, Osama Mousa, Alaa Abd-alrazaq, Arfan Ahmed, Tanvir Alam, Mowafa Househ.

  abstract={PURPOSE: Workplace-based assessment (WBA) serves a critical role in supporting competency-based medical education (CBME) by providing assessment data to inform competency decisions and support learning. Many WBA systems have been developed, but little is known about how to effectively implement WBA. Filling this gap is important for creating suitable and beneficial assessment processes that support large-scale use of CBME. As a step toward filling this gap, the authors describe what is known about WBA implementation and use to identify knowledge gaps and future directions. METHOD: The authors used Arksey and O'Malley's 6-stage scoping review framework to conduct the review, including: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and (6) consulting with relevant stakeholders. RESULTS: In 2019-2020, the authors searched and screened 726 papers for eligibility using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. One hundred sixty-three met inclusion criteria. The authors identified 5 themes in their analysis: (1) Many WBA tools and programs have been implemented, and barriers are common across fields and specialties; (2) Theoretical perspectives emphasize the need for data-driven implementation strategies; (3) User perceptions of WBA vary and are often dependent on implementation factors; (4) Technology solutions could provide useful tools to support WBA; and (5) Many areas of future research and innovation remain. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of WBA as an implemented practice to support CBME remains constrained. To remove these constraints, future research should aim to generate generalizable knowledge on WBA implementation and use, address implementation factors, and investigate remaining knowledge gaps.

  abstract={Aims: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is the most common metabolic disorder of pregnancy, requiring complex management and empowerment of those affected. Mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) are proposed for streamlining healthcare service delivery, extending care relationships into the community, and empowering those affected by prolonged medical disorders to be equal collaborators in their healthcare. This review investigates mHealth apps intended for use with GDM; specifically those powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or providing decision support. Methods: A scoping review using the novel Survey Tool approach for collaborative literature Reviews (STaR) process was performed. Results: From 18 papers, 11 discrete GDM-based mHealth apps were identified, but only 3 were reasonably mature with only one currently in use in a clinical setting. Two-thirds of the apps provided condition-relevant contextual user feedback that could aid in patient self care. However, although each app targeted one or more components of the GDM clinical pathway, no app addressed the entirety from diagnosis to postpartum. Conclusions: There are limited mHealth apps for GDM that incorporate AI or AI-based decision support. Many exist only to record patient information like blood glucose readings or diet, provide generic patient education or advice, or to reduce adverse events by providing medication or appointment alerts. Significant barriers remain that continue to limit the adoption of mHealth apps in clinical care settings. Further research and development are needed to deliver intelligent holistic mHealth apps using AI that can truly reduce healthcare resource use and improve outcomes by enabling patient self care in the community. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) offers vigorous statistical and probabilistic techniques that can successfully predict certain clinical conditions using large volumes of data. A review of ML and big data research analytics in maternal depression is pertinent and timely, given the rapid technological developments in recent years. Objective: This study aims to synthesize the literature on ML and big data analytics for maternal mental health, particularly the prediction of postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: We used a scoping review methodology using the Arksey and O'Malley framework to rapidly map research activity in ML for predicting PPD. Two independent researchers searched PsycINFO, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and the ACM Digital Library in September 2020 to identify relevant publications in the past 12 years. Data were extracted from the articles'ML model, data type, and study results. Results: A total of 14 studies were identified. All studies reported the use of supervised learning techniques to predict PPD. Support vector machine and random forest were the most commonly used algorithms in addition to Naive Bayes, regression, artificial neural network, decision trees, and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). There was considerable heterogeneity in the best-performing ML algorithm across the selected studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values reported for different algorithms were support vector machine (range 0.78-0.86), random forest method (0.88), XGBoost (0.80), and logistic regression (0.93). Conclusions: ML algorithms can analyze larger data sets and perform more advanced computations, which can significantly improve the detection of PPD at an early stage. Further clinical research collaborations are required to fine-tune ML algorithms for prediction and treatment. ML might become part of evidence-based practice in addition to clinical knowledge and existing research evidence. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Objective: To assess a common hypothesis that data serve as a mechanism to improve health and health equity in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), we conducted a synthesis of the evidence about the linkage between data capabilities in LMICs and health outcomes. Methods: We searched and reviewed peer-reviewed and grey literature published in the past decade that focused on at least one aspect of health data or health equity or provided insights on the relationship between data use and improved health outcomes, decision-making, or both. We supplemented this with expert interviews and convenience-sampled literature. Results: Of the 50 included articles, 33 discussed data collection, with 23 stating that poor accuracy, reliability, and completeness hindered data-informed decision-making. Of 27 articles discussing data access, 18 described how lack of interoperability between data systems hampered governments’ and other organizations’ ability to leverage the full value of data available. Of 19 articles discussing data use, 13 discussed how data were not getting to those doing work on the ground. Although key informants postulated a virtuous cycle between data and improved health outcomes, evidence did not support this connection. Conclusions: Findings indicate better data might improve health service delivery. However, more work is needed to examine whether improvements in data yield improvements in health outcomes in LMICs. Our conceptual framework of data equity for health and health equity developed through this scoping review helps identify the key components along which to assess improvements in LMICs’ data capabilities. © The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract={The article is a scoping review of the literature on the use of decision support systems based on artificial neural networks in emergency surgery. The authors present modern literature data on the effectiveness of artificial neural networks for predicting, diagnosing and treating abdominal emergency conditions: acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer, acute intestinal obstruction, and strangulated hernia. The intelligent systems developed at present allow a surgeon in an emergency setting, not only to check his own diagnostic and prognostic assumptions, but also to use artificial intelligence in complex urgent clinical cases. The authors summarize the main limitations for the implementation of artificial neural networks in surgery and medicine in general. These limitations are the lack of transparency in the decision-making process; insufficient quality educational medical data; lack of qualified personnel; high cost of projects; and the complexity of secure storage of medical information data. The development and implementation of decision support systems based on artificial neural networks is a promising direction for improving the forecasting, diagnosis and treatment of emergency surgical diseases and their complications. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={No comprehensive review of Bayesian networks (BNs) in healthcare has been published in the past, making it difficult to organize the research contributions in the present and identify challenges and neglected areas that need to be addressed in the future. This unique and novel scoping review of BNs in healthcare provides an analytical framework for comprehensively characterizing the domain and its current state. A literature search of health and health informatics literature databases using relevant keywords found 3810 articles that were reduced to 123. This was after screening out those presenting Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis or neural networks, as opposed to BNs and those describing the predictive performance of multiple machine learning algorithms, of which BNs were simply one type. Using the novel analytical framework, we show that: (1) BNs in healthcare are not used to their full potential; (2) a generic BN development process is lacking; (3) limitations exist in the way BNs in healthcare are presented in the literature, which impacts understanding, consensus towards systematic methodologies, practice and adoption; and (4) a gap exists between having an accurate BN and a useful BN that impacts clinical practice. This review highlights several neglected issues, such as restricted aims of BNs, ad hoc BN development methods, and the lack of BN adoption in practice and reveals to researchers and clinicians the need to address these problems. To map the way forward, the paper proposes future research directions and makes recommendations regarding BN development methods and adoption in practice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Objective: To present an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to regulate eating and dietary behaviours, exercise behaviours and weight loss. Design: A scoping review of global literature published from inception to 15 December 2020 was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's five-step framework. Eight databases (CINAHL, Cochrane-Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched. Included studies were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers with good interrater reliability (k = 0·96). Results: Sixty-six out of 5573 potential studies were included, representing more than 2031 participants. Three tenets of self-regulation were identified - self-monitoring (n 66, 100 %), optimisation of goal setting (n 10, 15·2 %) and self-control (n 10, 15·2 %). Articles were also categorised into three AI applications, namely machine perception (n 50), predictive analytics only (n 6) and real-time analytics with personalised micro-interventions (n 10). Machine perception focused on recognising food items, eating behaviours, physical activities and estimating energy balance. Predictive analytics focused on predicting weight loss, intervention adherence, dietary lapses and emotional eating. Studies on the last theme focused on evaluating AI-assisted weight management interventions that instantaneously collected behavioural data, optimised prediction models for behavioural lapse events and enhance behavioural self-control through adaptive and personalised nudges/prompts. Only six studies reported average weight losses (2·4-4·7 %) of which two were statistically significant. Conclusion: The use of AI for weight loss is still undeveloped. Based on the current study findings, we proposed a framework on the applicability of AI for weight loss but cautioned its contingency upon engagement and contextualisation. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

  abstract={Background: Complications due to type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be mitigated through proper self-management that can positively change health behaviors. Technological tools are available to help people living with, or at risk of developing, T2D to manage their condition, and such tools provide a large repository of patient-generated health data (PGHD). Analytics can provide insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. Objective: The aim of this review is to investigate what can be learned about the health behaviors of those living with, or at risk of developing, T2D through analytics from PGHD. Methods: A scoping review using the Arksey and O’Malley framework was conducted in which a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted by 2 reviewers. In all, 3 electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) were searched using keywords associated with diabetes, behaviors, and analytics. Several rounds of screening using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were conducted, after which studies were selected. Critical examination took place through a descriptive-analytical narrative method, and data extracted from the studies were classified into thematic categories. These categories reflect the findings of this study as per our objective. Results: We identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although 70% (30/43) of the studies examined PGHD independently, 30% (13/43) combined PGHD with other data sources. Most of these studies used machine learning algorithms to perform their analysis. The themes identified through this review include predicting diabetes or obesity, deriving factors that contribute to diabetes or obesity, obtaining insights from social media or web-based forums, predicting glycemia, improving adherence and outcomes, analyzing sedentary behaviors, deriving behavior patterns, discovering clinical correlations from behaviors, and developing design principles. Conclusions: The increased volume and availability of PGHD have the potential to derive analytical insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. From the literature, we determined that analytics can predict outcomes and identify granular behavior patterns from PGHD. This review determined the broad range of insights that can be examined through PGHD, which constitutes a unique source of data for these applications that would not be possible through the use of other data sources. © Meghan S Nagpal, Antonia Barbaric, Diana Sherifali, Plinio P Morita, Joseph A Cafazzo.},

  abstract={Background: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that has been ranked second after Alzheimer’s disease worldwide. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to combat against PD to allow patients to deal with it properly. However, there is no medical test(s) available to diagnose PD conclusively. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems offered a better solution to make the necessary data-driven decisions and assist the physician. Numerous studies were conducted to propose CAD to diagnose PD in the early stages. No comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize the role of AI tools to combat PD. Objective: The study aimed to explore and summarize the applications of neural networks to diagnose PD. Methods: PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was followed to conduct this scoping review. To identify the relevant studies, both medical databases (e.g., PubMed) and technical databases (IEEE) were searched. Three reviewers carried out the study selection and extracted the data from the included studies independently. Then, the narrative approach was adopted to synthesis the extracted data. Results: Out of 1061 studies, 91 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria in this review. About half of the included studies have implemented artificial neural networks to diagnose PD. Numerous studies included focused on the freezing of gait (FoG). Biomedical voice and signal datasets were the most commonly used data types to develop and validate these models. However, MRI-and CT-scan images were also utilized in the included studies. Conclusion: Neural networks play an integral and substantial role in combating PD. Many possible applications of neural networks were identified in this review, however, most of them are limited up to research purposes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Assistive technology (AT) with context-aware computing and artificial intelligence capabilities can be applied to address cognitive and communication impairments experienced by persons with dementia (PwD). This paper aims to provide an overview of current literature regarding some characteristics of intelligent assistive technology devices (IATDs) for cognitive and communicative impairments of PwD. It also aims to identify the areas of impairment addressed by these IATDs. A multi-faceted systematic search strategy yielded records. Predefined criteria were applied for inclusion and data extraction. Thereafter data was thematically analysed and synthesised. This review demonstrates that almost all of the research involving IATDs has focused on cognitive impairments of PwD and has not yet evolved past the conceptual or prototype stages of development. Summaries of commercially available IATDs for PwD and relevant prototypes are provided at the end of this review. This research concluded that IATDs for PwD targeting cognition and communication problems primarily focus on social robots, and that they address cognitive impairments of attention, affect, and social-pragmatic communicative impairments. Future research endeavours concerning AT for PwD should explore collaboration between computer engineering and health practitioners to address the identified gaps. This may contribute to the available information for evidence-based decision making for PwD. © 2021 RESNA.},

  abstract={Background The development of mobile computing technology has enabled the delivery of psychological interventions while people go about their everyday lives. The original visions of the potential of these “ecological momentary interventions” were presented over a decade ago, and the widespread adoption of smartphones in the intervening years has led to a variety of research studies exploring the feasibility of these aspirations. However, there is a dearth of research describing the different dimensions, characteristics, and features of these interventions, as constructed. Objective To provide an overview of the definitions given for “ecological momentary interventions” in the treatment of common mental health disorders, and describe the set of technological and interaction possibilities which have been used in the design of these interventions. Methods A systematic search identified relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and ACM Guide to the Computing Literature databases. Following screening, data were extracted from eligible articles using a standardized extraction worksheet. Selected articles were then thematically categorized. Results The search identified 583 articles of which 64 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions target a range of mental health problems, with diverse aims, intervention designs and evaluation approaches. The studies employed a variety of features for intervention delivery, but recent research is overwhelmingly comprised of studies based on smartphone apps (30 of 42 papers that described an intervention). Twenty two studies employed sensors for the collection of data in order to provide just-in-time support or predict psychological states. Conclusions With the shift towards smartphone apps, the vision for EMIs has begun to be realised. Recent years have seen increased exploration of the use of sensors and machine learning, but the role of humans in the delivery of EMI is also varied. The variety of capabilities exhibited by EMIs motivates development of a more precise vocabulary for capturing both automatic and human tailoring of these interventions.

  abstract={Background: eHealth has a notable potential to help in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, screening, management, and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since ehealth is considered here broadly, as an umbrella term, it also covers subsets like telehealth and mhealth. This study aimed to review the literature to identify and classify subdomains of eHealth solutions that have been utilized, developed, or suggested for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane library databases in April 2020, with no time limitation. The search strategy was built based on 2 concept domains of eHealth solutions and covid-19. For each concept domain, the search query comprised a combination of free text keywords identified from reference papers and controlled vocabulary terms. Obtained results were classified, graphically presented, and discussed. Results: Of the 423 studies identified initially, 35 were included in this study. From related papers, general characteristics, study objective, eHealth-related outcomes, target populations, eHealth interventions, health service category, eHealth solution, and eHealth domain were extracted, classified, and tabulated. Most publication types were ideas, editorials, or opinions (46%). The most targeted populations were people of the community and medical staff (80%). The most implemented or suggested eHealth solution was telehealth (63%), followed by mhealth, health information technology, and health data analytics. Most of the COVID-19 ehealth interventions designed or suggested for improving prevention (48%) and diagnosis (48%). Most of the studies applied or proposed eHealth solutions for general practice or epidemiological purposes (48%). Conclusion: eHealth solutions have the potential to provide useful services to help in COVID-19 pandemics in terms of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, screening, surveillance, resource allocation, education, management, and control. The obtained results from this review might be used for a better understanding of current ehealth solutions provided or recommended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The article is a scoping review that aims to trace the emerging issues in the field of research methodology. The online research has embraced the most disparate fields of research, in this review we have chosen to circumscribe to three main themes: education, psychological factors in elearning and working from home. Specifically, the emergence of an important amount of data such as big data and learning analytics made it necessary to review the purposes, methods of analyzing and reading emerging data in research contexts. The emerging themes during the pandemic related to education, psychological factors in elearning and working from home have had a research intervention due to social isolation and the need for such application models in the context of the pandemic. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

  abstract={A health technology assessment (HTA) is commonly defined as a multidisciplinary approach used to evaluate medical, social, economic, and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, robust manner. To help inform HTA recommendations, the surveillance of social media platforms can provide important insights to the clinical community and to decision makers on the effectiveness and safety of the use of health technologies on a patient. A scoping review of the published literature was performed to gain some insight on the accuracy and automation of sentiment analysis (SA) used to assess public opinion on the use of health technologies. A literature search of major databases was conducted. The main search concepts were SA, social media, and patient perspective. Among the 1,776 unique citations identified, 12 studies that described the use of SA methods to evaluate public opinion on or experiences with the use of health technologies as posted on social media platforms were included. The SA methods used were either lexicon-or machine learning-based. Two studies focused on medical devices, three examined HPV vaccination, and the remaining studies targeted drug therapies. Due to the limitations and inherent differences among SA tools, the outcomes of these applications should be considered exploratory. The results of our study can initiate discussions on how the automation of algorithms to interpret public opinion of health technologies should be further developed to optimize the use of data available on social media.  © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Supervised machine learning (ML) is a class of algorithms that “learn” from existing input–output pairs, which is gaining popularity in pattern recognition for classification and prediction problems. In this scoping review, we examined the use of supervised ML algorithms for the prediction of long-term allograft survival in kidney transplant recipients. Data sources included PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore libraries from inception to November 2019. We screened titles and abstracts and potentially eligible full-text reports to select studies and subsequently abstracted the data. Eleven studies were identified. Decision trees were the most commonly used method (n = 8), followed by artificial neural networks (ANN) (n = 4) and Bayesian belief networks (n = 2). The area under receiver operating curve (AUC) was the most common measure of discrimination (n = 7), followed by sensitivity (n = 5) and specificity (n = 4). Model calibration examining the reliability in risk prediction was performed using either the Pearson r or the Hosmer–Lemeshow test in four studies. One study showed that logistic regression had comparable performance to ANN, while another study demonstrated that ANN performed better in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared with a Cox proportional hazards model. We synthesized the evidence related to the comparison of ML techniques with traditional statistical approaches for prediction of long-term allograft survival in patients with a kidney transplant. The methodological and reporting quality of included studies was poor. Our study also demonstrated mixed results in terms of the predictive potential of the models. © 2020, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.},

  abstract={Given the high prevalence and associated cost of chronic pain, it has a significant impact on individuals and society. Improvements in the treatment and management of chronic pain may increase patients’ quality of life and reduce societal costs. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in chronic pain research. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library databases. Relevant studies were identified by screening titles and abstracts for keywords related to chronic pain and machine learning, followed by analysing full texts. Two hundred and eighty-seven publications were identified in the literature search. In total, fifty-three papers on chronic pain research and machine learning were reviewed. The review showed that while many studies have emphasised machine learning-based classification for the diagnosis of chronic pain, far less attention has been paid to the treatment and management of chronic pain. More research is needed on machine learning approaches to the treatment, rehabilitation, and self-management of chronic pain. As with other chronic conditions, patient involvement and self-management are crucial. In order to achieve this, patients with chronic pain need digital tools that can help them make decisions about their own treatment and care. © 2021 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Visual analytics (VA) promotes the understanding of data with visual, interactive techniques, using analytic and visual engines. The analytic engine includes automated techniques, whereas common visual outputs include flow maps and spatiotemporal hot spots. Objective: This scoping review aims to address a gap in the literature, with the specific objective to synthesize literature on the use of VA tools, techniques, and frameworks in interrelated health care areas of population health and health services research (HSR). Methods: Using the 2018 PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, the review focuses on peer-reviewed journal articles and full conference papers from 2005 to March 2019. Two researchers were involved at each step, and another researcher arbitrated disagreements. A comprehensive abstraction platform captured data from diverse bodies of the literature, primarily from the computer and health sciences. Results: After screening 11,310 articles, findings from 55 articles were synthesized under the major headings of visual and analytic engines, visual presentation characteristics, tools used and their capabilities, application to health care areas, data types and sources, VA frameworks, frameworks used for VA applications, availability and innovation, and co-design initiatives. We found extensive application of VA methods used in areas of epidemiology, surveillance and modeling, health services access, use, and cost analyses. All articles included a distinct analytic and visualization engine, with varying levels of detail provided. Most tools were prototypes, with 5 in use at the time of publication. Seven articles presented methodological frameworks. Toward consistent reporting, we present a checklist, with an expanded definition for VA applications in health care, to assist researchers in sharing research for greater replicability. We summarized the results in a Tableau dashboard. Conclusions: With the increasing availability and generation of big health care data, VA is a fast-growing method applied to complex health care data. What makes VA innovative is its capability to process multiple, varied data sources to demonstrate trends and patterns for exploratory analysis, leading to knowledge generation and decision support. This is the first review to bridge a critical gap in the literature on VA methods applied to the areas of population health and HSR, which further indicates possible avenues for the adoption of these methods in the future. This review is especially important in the wake of COVID-19 surveillance and response initiatives, where many VA products have taken center stage. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

  abstract={Background: COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health. Methods: In order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers’ needs. Results: Review findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health. Conclusions: Though there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.},

We reviewed peer-reviewed and grey-literature articles of 2007 to 2018 describing the perspectives of staff and students in tertiary education on the use of student-generated data in data analytics, including learning analytics. We used an ethics framework to categorize the findings. There was considerable variation but generally low awareness and understanding amongst students and staff about the nature and extent of data collection, data analytics, and use of predictive analytics. Staff and students identified potential benefits but also expressed concerns about misinterpretation of data, constant surveillance, poor transparency, inadequate support, and potential to impede active learning. This review supports the contention that consideration of ethical issues has failed to keep pace with the development of predictive analytics in the tertiary sector. © 2020 AERA.},

  abstract={Research into medical artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years, including surgical applications. This scoping review investigated AI-based decision support systems targeted at the intraoperative phase of surgery and found a wide range of technological approaches applied across several surgical specialties. Within the twenty-one (n = 21) included papers, three main categories of motivations were identified for developing such technologies: (1) augmenting the information available to surgeons, (2) accelerating intraoperative pathology, and (3) recommending surgical steps. While many of the proposals hold promise for improving patient outcomes, important methodological shortcomings were observed in most of the reviewed papers that made it difficult to assess the clinical significance of the reported performance statistics. Despite limitations, the current state of this field suggests that a number of opportunities exist for future researchers and clinicians to work on AI for surgical decision support with exciting implications for improving surgical care. © 2020, Higher Education Press.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Rare Diseases (RDs), which are defined as diseases affecting no more than 5 out of 10,000 people, are often severe, chronic and life-threatening. A main problem is the delay in diagnosing RDs. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for RDs are software systems to support clinicians in the diagnosis of patients with RDs. Due to their clinical importance, we conducted a scoping review to determine which CDSSs are available to support the diagnosis of RDs patients, whether the CDSSs are available to be used by clinicians and which functionalities and data are used to provide decision support. METHODS: We searched PubMed for CDSSs in RDs published between December 16, 2008 and December 16, 2018. Only English articles, original peer reviewed journals and conference papers describing a clinical prototype or a routine use of CDSSs were included. For data charting, we used the data items "Objective and background of the publication/project", "System or project name", "Functionality", "Type of clinical data", "Rare Diseases covered", "Development status", "System availability", "Data entry and integration", "Last software update" and "Clinical usage". RESULTS: The search identified 636 articles. After title and abstracting screening, as well as assessing the eligibility criteria for full-text screening, 22 articles describing 19 different CDSSs were identified. Three types of CDSSs were classified: "Analysis or comparison of genetic and phenotypic data," "machine learning" and "information retrieval". Twelve of nineteen CDSSs use phenotypic and genetic data, followed by clinical data, literature databases and patient questionnaires. Fourteen of nineteen CDSSs are fully developed systems and therefore publicly available. Data can be entered or uploaded manually in six CDSSs, whereas for four CDSSs no information for data integration was available. Only seven CDSSs allow further ways of data integration. thirteen CDSS do not provide information about clinical usage. CONCLUSIONS: Different CDSS for various purposes are available, yet clinicians have to determine which is best for their patient. To allow a more precise usage, future research has to focus on CDSSs RDs data integration, clinical usage and updating clinical knowledge. It remains interesting which of the CDSSs will be used and maintained in the future.},

  abstract={Background: The development and use of mobile health applications (mHealth Apps) have increased drastically over the last few years. There is an evident lack of the needed evidence to support the scalability and sustainability of these mHealth Apps. The vast number of mHealth Apps commercially available on App Stores makes it difficult to select the most effective and trustworthy Apps. Continuous evaluation of these Apps needs to be implemented or conducted to establish the needed evidence-base. Traditional methods for evaluating health interventions are not suitable for the quick and agile approach needed to develop and maintain Apps. In search of alternative and consistent standards and guidelines new evaluation methods are proposed. The aim of this article is to investigate the state of the literature in this regard. A scoping review is conducted to identify how mHealth Apps are currently evaluated, with a focus on data analytics. Method: Five stages of conducting a scoping review are implemented: 1) identifying the research questions 2) identifying the relevant studies 3) study selection 4) data charting and 5) collecting, summarising, and reporting the results. Electronic databases used for the literature search included Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and JMIR. Using the identified search terms for the scope-specific contents and two levels of screening 43 documents were included for the final data extraction. Results: There is an increasing trend within the published works in our database, specifically peaking in 2018 and 2019. Usability and Effectiveness Evaluations are the most common reported evaluations for mHealth Apps. User surveys are the most frequently used traditional evaluation method, together with statistical analysis. Newly proposed evaluation methods include log or usage data analytics or implementing new frameworks. Conclusion: This scoping review highlighted the value of conducting further research for the standardization of the evaluation of mHealth Apps. A growing trend and implementation of data analytics are observed within the health domain. We conclude that a framework that incorporates data analytic tools and techniques would be of great value to mHealth App developers, evaluators, and users. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

  abstract={Background: Medication adherence has been studied in different settings, with different approaches, and applying different methodologies. Nevertheless, our knowledge and efficacy are quite limited in terms of measuring and evaluating all the variables and components that affect the management of medication adherence regimes as a complex phenomenon. The study aim is mapping the state-of-the-art of medication adherence measurement and assessment methods applied in chronic conditions. Specifically, we are interested in what methods and assessment procedures are currently used to tackle medication adherence. We explore whether Big Data techniques are adopted to improve decision-making procedures regarding patients' adherence, and the possible role of digital technologies in supporting interventions for improving patient adherence and avoiding waste or harm. Methods: A scoping literature review and bibliometric analysis were used. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was adopted to scope the review process, and a bibliometric analysis was applied to observe the evolution of the scientific literature and identify specific characteristics of the related knowledge domain. Results: A total of 533 articles were retrieved from the Scopus academic database and selected for the bibliometric analysis. Sixty-one studies were identified and included in the final analysis. The Morisky medication adherence scale (36%) was the most frequently adopted baseline measurement tool, and cardiovascular/hypertension disease, the most investigated illness (38%). Heterogeneous findings emerged from the types of study design and the statistical methodologies used to assess and compare the results. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a lack of Big Data applications currently deployed to address or measure medication adherence in chronic conditions. Our study proposes a general framework to select the methods, measurements and the corpus of variables in which the treatment regime can be analyzed.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract={The Flipped Classroom (FC) is an instruction method, where the traditional lecture and homework sessions are inverted. Online material is given to students in order to gain necessary knowledge before class, while class time is devoted to application of this knowledge and reflection. The hypothesis is that there could be deep and creative discussions when teacher and students physically meet, which has known a significant surge of popularity in the past decade. A marked recent trend in the FC is the increased use of Learning Analytics (LA) to support the development of the FC and students’ reflexive learning. The aim of this paper is to investigate the literature on applications of LA in FCs, and to determine the best practices and needs for technological development supporting LA in the FC by means of a scoping review. This literature review revealed that there is potential in using LA in the FC, especially as a means to predict students’ learning outcome and to support adaptive learning and improvement on the curriculum. However, further long-term studies and development is necessary to encourage self-directed learning in students and to develop the whole of the FC for a more diverse population of students. We anticipate an increased and expanded use of LA to come, with focus on predictive and prescriptive analytics providing more adaptive learning experience. We also anticipate that LA will expand beyond data mining to correlate student performance and online engagement with the aim to include a wider range of possibilities of interventions and adaptation of the learning experience. © ACPIL.},

  abstract={Background: Polypharmacy is a key challenge in healthcare especially in older and multimorbid patients. The use of multiple medications increases the potential for drug interactions and for prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. eHealth solutions are increasingly recommended in healthcare, with big data analysis techniques as a major component. In the following we use the term analysis of big data as referring to the computational analysis of large data sets to find patterns, trends, and associations in large data sets collected from a wide range of sources in contrast to using classical statistics programs. It is hypothesized that big data analysis is able to reveal patterns in patient data that would not be identifiable using conventional methods of data analysis. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether there are existing big data analysis techniques that can help to identify patients consuming multiple drugs and to assist in the reduction of polypharmacy in patients. Methods: A computerized search was conducted in February 2019 and updated in May 2020, using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. The search strategy was defined by the principles of a systematic search, using the PICO scheme. All studies evaluating big data analytics about patients consuming multiple drugs were considered. Two researchers assessed all search results independently to identify eligible studies. The data was then extracted into standardized tables. Results: A total of 327 studies were identified through the database search. After title and abstract screening, 302 items were removed. Only three studies were identified as addressing big data analysis techniques in patients with polypharmacy. One study extracted antipsychotic polypharmacy data, the second introduced a decision support system to evaluate side-effects in patients with polypharmacy and the third evaluated a decision support system to identify polypharmacy-related problems in individuals. Conclusions: There are few studies to date which have used big data analysis techniques for identification and management of polypharmacy. There may be a need to further explore interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and healthcare professionals, to develop and evaluate big data analysis techniques that can be implemented to manage polypharmacy.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Social media is playing an increasingly central role in patient's decision-making process. Advances in technology have enabled meaningful interpretation of discussions on social media. We conducted a scoping review to assess whether Sentiment Analysis (SA), a big data analytic tool, could be used to extract meaningful themes from social media discussions on pharmacotherapy. A keyword search strategy was used on the following databases: OneSearch, PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane. One hundred and ninety-four titles were identified of which 10 studies were included. We extracted themes about uses and implications of SA of social media discussions on pharmacotherapy. Twitter was the most frequently analyzed platform. Assessment of public sentiment about a particular medication was the most common use of SA followed by detection of adverse drug reactions. Studies also revealed a significant impact of news media on public sentiment. Implications for real world practice include identifying reasons for a negative sentiment, detecting adverse drug reactions and using the impact of news media on social media sentiment to drive public health initiatives. The lack of a consistent approach to SA between the studies reflects the lack of a gold standard for the technology and consequently the need for future research. Sentiment Analysis is a promising technology that can allow us to better understand patient opinion regarding pharmacotherapy. This knowledge can be used to improve patient safety, patient- physician interaction, and also enhance the delivery of public health measures. © 2020 The Authors.

  abstract={Self-regulated learning (SRL) can predict academic performance. Yet, it is difficult for learners. The ability to self-regulate learning becomes even more important in emerging online learning settings. To support learners in developing their SRL, learning analytics (LA), which can improve learning practice by transforming the ways we support learning, is critical. This scoping review is based on the analysis of 54 papers on LA empirical research for SRL in online learning contexts published between 2011 and 2019. The research question is: What is the current state of the applications of learning analytics to measure and support students'SRL in online learning environments? The focus is on SRL phases, methods, forms of SRL support, evidence for LA and types of online learning settings. Zimmerman's model (2002) was used to examine SRL phases. The evidence about LA was examined in relation to four propositions: whether LA i) improve learning outcomes, ii) improve learning support and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) used ethically. Results showed most studies focused on SRL parts from the forethought and performance phase but much less focus on reflection. We found little evidence for LA that showed i) improvements in learning outcomes (20%), ii) improvements in learning support and teaching (22%). LA was also found iii) not used widely and iv) few studies (15%) approached research ethically. Overall, the findings show LA research was conducted mainly to measure rather than to support SRL. Thus, there is a critical need to exploit the LA support mechanisms further in order to ultimately use them to foster student SRL in online learning environments. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Advances in medical technology produce highly complex datasets in neurorehabilitation clinics and research laboratories. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized to analyze big and complex datasets in various fields, but the use of ANNs in neurorehabilitation is limited. OBJECTIVE: To explore the current use of ANNs in neurorehabilitation. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were used for the literature search. Studies in the scoping review (1) utilized ANNs, (2) examined populations with neurological conditions, and (3) focused on rehabilitation outcomes. The initial search identified 1,136 articles. A total of 19 articles were included. RESULTS: ANNs were used for prediction of functional outcomes and mortality (n=11) and classification of motor symptoms and cognitive status (n=8). Most ANN-based models outperformed regression or other machine learning models (n=11) and showed accurate performance (n=6; no comparison with other models) in predicting clinical outcomes and accurately classifying different neurological impairments. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review provides encouraging evidence to use ANNs for clinical decision-making of complex datasets in neurorehabilitation. However, more research is needed to establish the clinical utility of ANNs in diagnosing, monitoring, and rehabilitation of individuals with neurological conditions. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

A scoping review was presented following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. MEDLINE, Emerald, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched in July 2016 using uniform keywords for documents that discuss data mining and knowledge discovery, dashboards, geographical information systems, and electronic surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in surveillance systems. Our study mainly focused on knowledge discovery and visualization algorithms, methods, and techniques used in antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems. Thirteen of the reviewed articles applied algorithms to the data mining process. A comparative table of data elements in the reviewed studies was extracted. The characteristics of antimicrobial dashboards were discussed. Heat maps were the most popular method used to visualize the intensity of resistance. Comparative tables are provided in each section of this paper. Data mining, Decision Support Systems, Geographic Information Systems, and dashboards can be integrated for data analysis and to better solve decision support problems. Bio-surveillance systems should be designed and analyzed based on four categories: data mining, dashboards, geography information system, and decision support modules. Furthermore, some questionnaires and checklists were developed and validated to capture related Business Intelligence and analytical requirements.

  abstract={PURPOSE Rapid increases in technology and data motivate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to primary care, but no comprehensive review exists to guide these efforts. Our objective was to assess the nature and extent of the body of research on AI for primary care. METHODS We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published or gray literature databases with terms pertaining to AI (eg, machine learning, bayes* network) and primary care (eg, general pract*, nurse). We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by 7 attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS Of 5,515 unique documents, 405 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS Research on AI for primary care is at an early stage of maturity. For the field to progress, more interdisciplinary research teams with end-user engagement and evaluation studies are needed. © 2020, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The availability of healthcare data has exponentially grown, both in quantity and complexity. The speed of this evolution has generated new challenges for translating complex data into effective evidence-informed policy. Visual analytics offers new capacity to analyze healthcare systems and support better decision-making. We conducted a systematic scoping review to look for evidence of visual analytics approaches being applied to mental healthcare systems and their use in driving policy. We found 79 relevant studies and categorized them in two ways: by study purpose and by type of visualization. The majority (67.1%)of the studies used geographical maps, and 11% conducted highly complex studies requiring novel visualizations. Significantly, only 15% of the studies provided information indicating high levels of usability for policy and planning. Our findings suggest that while visual analytics continues to evolve rapidly, there is a need to ensure this evolution reflects the practical needs of policy makers. © 2019 The Authors},

  abstract={Objectives: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly applied for medical image diagnostics. We performed a scoping review, exploring (1) use cases, (2) methodologies and (3) findings of studies applying CNN on dental image material. Sources: Medline via PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv were searched. Study selection: Full-text articles and conference-proceedings reporting CNN application on dental imagery were included. Data: Thirty-six studies, published 2015-2019, were included, mainly from four countries (South Korea, United States, Japan, China). Studies focussed on general dentistry (n = 15 studies), cariology (n = 5), endodontics (n = 2), periodontology (n = 3), orthodontics (n = 3), dental radiology (2), forensic dentistry (n = 2) and general medicine (n = 4). Most often, the detection, segmentation or classification of anatomical structures, including teeth (n = 9), jaw bone (n = 2) and skeletal landmarks (n = 4) was performed. Detection of pathologies focused on caries (n = 3). The most commonly used image type were panoramic radiographs (n = 11), followed by periapical radiographs (n = 8), Cone-Beam CT or conventional CT (n = 6). Dataset sizes varied between 10–5,166 images (mean 1,053). Most studies used medical professionals to label the images and constitute the reference test. A large range of outcome metrics was employed, hampering comparisons across studies. A comparison of the CNN performance against an independent test group of dentists was provided by seven studies; most studies found the CNN to perform similar to dentists. Applicability or impact on treatment decision was not assessed at all. Conclusions: CNNs are increasingly employed for dental image diagnostics in research settings. Their usefulness, safety and generalizability should be demonstrated using more rigorous, replicable and comparable methodology. Clinical significance: CNNs may be used in diagnostic-assistance systems, thereby assisting dentists in a more comprehensive, systematic and faster evaluation and documentation of dental images. CNNs may become applicable in routine care; however, prior to that, the dental community should appraise them against the rules of evidence-based practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={The Flipped Classroom (FC) is an instruction method, where “events that have traditionally taken place inside the classroom now take place outside and vice versa”, which has known a significant surge of popularity in the past decade. In FCs, different types of activities may take place depending on the session type (pre-class, in-class, or after-class), the learning objectives to fulfil, the type and size of the class, the available infrastructure, the time available etc. In order to support the activities taking place in FCs, instructors can use various technological tools and online environment, especially to support the preparation of students before class. A marked recent trend in the FC is the increased use of Learning Analytics (LA) to support the development of the FC and students’ reflexive learning. However, there has been no systematic investigation into combining LA and the FC, and it appeared that there was a lack of research on the issue. The aim of this paper is to investigate the literature on applications of LA in FCs, and to determine the best practices and needs for technological development supporting LA in the FC. In order to perform this study, we did a scoping review of literature in the subject to determine research trends in the use of LA in the FC. We conclude that there is great potential to use LA in the FC, and try to project where further research is heading. © The Authors, 2019. All Rights Reserved.},

Analysis of academic research and online search traffic since 2002 revealed changes in the relative trajectory of PA and conceptually related terms over the past fifteen years, indicating both the re-branding of similar innovations and a differentiation of priorities and communities of practice. The market in commercial PA tools and services is diverse, offering numerous functional and strategic benefits, although published evidence of these outcomes remains sparse. Companies marketing PA systems and services emphasise benefits to employers more than to personnel. Across the sources examined, including specialised online courses, PA was largely aligned with HRM, however its development reflects the shifting focus of HR departments from supporting functional to strategic organisational requirements. Consideration of ethical issues was largely absent. © 2018 The Authors},

  abstract={Background: There is mixed evidence to support current ambitions for mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve chronic health and well-being. One proposed explanation for this variable effect is that users do not engage with apps as intended. The application of analytics, defined as the use of data to generate new insights, is an emerging approach to study and interpret engagement with mHealth interventions. Objective: This study aimed to consolidate how analytic indicators of engagement have previously been applied across clinical and technological contexts, to inform how they might be optimally applied in future evaluations. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to catalog the range of analytic indicators being used in evaluations of consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions. We categorized studies according to app structure and application of engagement data and calculated descriptive data for each category. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests of independence were applied to calculate differences between coded variables. Results: A total of 41 studies met our inclusion criteria. The average mHealth evaluation included for review was a two-group pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial of a hybrid-structured app for mental health self-management, had 103 participants, lasted 5 months, did not provide access to health care provider services, measured 3 analytic indicators of engagement, segmented users based on engagement data, applied engagement data for descriptive analyses, and did not report on attrition. Across the reviewed studies, engagement was measured using the following 7 analytic indicators: the number of measures recorded (76%, 31/41), the frequency of interactions logged (73%, 30/41), the number of features accessed (49%, 20/41), the number of log-ins or sessions logged (46%, 19/41), the number of modules or lessons started or completed (29%, 12/41), time spent engaging with the app (27%, 11/41), and the number or content of pages accessed (17%, 7/41). Engagement with unstructured apps was mostly measured by the number of features accessed (8/10, P=.04), and engagement with hybrid apps was mostly measured by the number of measures recorded (21/24, P=.03). A total of 24 studies presented, described, or summarized the data generated from applying analytic indicators to measure engagement. The remaining 17 studies used or planned to use these data to infer a relationship between engagement patterns and intended outcomes. Conclusions: Although researchers measured on average 3 indicators in a single study, the majority reported findings descriptively and did not further investigate how engagement with an app contributed to its impact on health and well-being. Researchers are gaining nuanced insights into engagement but are not yet characterizing effective engagement for improved outcomes. Raising the standard of mHealth app efficacy through measuring analytic indicators of engagement may enable greater confidence in the causal impact of apps on improved chronic health and well-being. ©Quynh Pham, Gary Graham, Carme Carrion, Plinio P Morita, Emily Seto, Jennifer N Stinson, Joseph A Cafazzo.},

  abstract={Background: The treatment of multimorbid patients is one crucial task in general practice as multimorbidity is highly prevalent in this setting. However, there is little evidence how to treat these patients and consequently there are but a few guidelines that focus primarily on multimorbidity. Big data analytics are defined as a method that obtains results for high volume data with high variety generated at high velocity. Yet, the explanatory power of these results is not completely understood. Nevertheless, addressing multimorbidity as a complex condition might be a promising field for big data analytics. The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate whether applying big data analytics on patient data does already contribute to the treatment of multimorbid patients in general practice. Methods: In January 2018, a review searching the databases PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, using defined search terms for "big data analytics" and "multimorbidity", supplemented by a search of grey literature with Google Scholar, was conducted. Studies were not filtered by type of study, publication year or language. Validity of studies was evaluated independently by two researchers. Results: In total, 2392 records were identified for screening. After title and abstract screening, six articles were included in the full-text analysis. Of those articles, one reported on a model generated with big data techniques to help caring for one group of multimorbid patients. The other five articles dealt with the analysis of multimorbidity clusters. No article defined big data analytics explicitly. Conclusions: Although the usage of the phrase "Big Data" is growing rapidly, there is nearly no practical use case for big data analysis techniques in the treatment of multimorbidity in general practice yet. Furthermore, in publications addressing big data analytics, the term is rarely defined. However, possible models and algorithms to address multimorbidity in the future are already published. © 2019 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Background This paper aims to synthesise the literature on machine learning (ML) and big data applications for mental health, highlighting current research and applications in practice.Methods We employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.Results Three hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.Conclusions Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field. © Cambridge University Press 2019.},

  abstract={Health care organizations are leveraging machine-learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), to improve delivery of care at a reduced cost. Applications of ANN to diagnosis are well-known; however, ANN are increasingly used to inform health care management decisions. We provide a seminal review of the applications of ANN to health care organizational decision-making. We screened 3,397 articles from six databases with coverage of Health Administration, Computer Science and Business Administration. We extracted study characteristics, aim, methodology and context (including level of analysis) from 80 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Articles were published from 1997–2018 and originated from 24 countries, with a plurality of papers (26 articles) published by authors from the United States. Types of ANN used included ANN (36 articles), feed-forward networks (25 articles), or hybrid models (23 articles); reported accuracy varied from 50% to 100%. The majority of ANN informed decision-making at the micro level (61 articles), between patients and health care providers. Fewer ANN were deployed for intra-organizational (meso- level, 29 articles) and system, policy or inter-organizational (macro- level, 10 articles) decision-making. Our review identifies key characteristics and drivers for market uptake of ANN for health care organizational decision-making to guide further adoption of this technique. © 2019 Shahid et al.

  abstract={Robotics, automation and artificial intelligence (RAAI) are changing how work gets done, to the point of putting 47% of existing jobs in the USA at risk of becoming redundant in 5 to 15 years. RAAI and their cognitive abilities have a potential impact on employees’ sense of self-worth and career satisfaction and, in turn, on organizations and the society as a whole. In spite of the significant debate on whether there is a real risk of job losses or simply a need of re-skilling, the impact of RAAI on the individual employee has received little attention in academic literature. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to explore the existing research and professional publications of different quality on the topic and analyze which aspects have received less attention, to properly support policymakers as well as managers' decisions. Existent research, covering different aspects, suggests that the majority of potentially affected workers is not aware nor worried about this ongoing transformation process and they are not properly planning their career. Involvement of the individual in this transition has been proved to bring positive results. However, to get such individual involvement, it will be necessary to identify the correct messages to inform and motivate to the change and avoid producing protests and resistance. For a successful transition, all the stakeholders, including the labor force, have to be part of this dialogue. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Background: Physicians and health policy makers are required to make predictions during their decision making in various medical problems. Many advances have been made in predictive modeling toward outcome prediction, but these innovations target an average patient and are insufficiently adjustable for individual patients. One developing idea in this field is individualized predictive analytics based on patient similarity. The goal of this approach is to identify patients who are similar to an index patient and derive insights from the records of similar patients to provide personalized predictions. Objective: The aim is to summarize and review published studies describing computer-based approaches for predicting patients' future health status based on health data and patient similarity, identify gaps, and provide a starting point for related future research. Methods: The method involved (1) conducting the review by performing automated searches in Scopus, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science, selecting relevant studies by first screening titles and abstracts then analyzing full-texts, and (2) documenting by extracting publication details and information on context, predictors, missing data, modeling algorithm, outcome, and evaluation methods into a matrix table, synthesizing data, and reporting results. Results: After duplicate removal, 1339 articles were screened in abstracts and titles and 67 were selected for full-text review. In total, 22 articles met the inclusion criteria. Within included articles, hospitals were the main source of data (n=10). Cardiovascular disease (n=7) and diabetes (n=4) were the dominant patient diseases. Most studies (n=18) used neighborhood-based approaches in devising prediction models. Two studies showed that patient similarity-based modeling outperformed population-based predictive methods. Conclusions: Interest in patient similarity-based predictive modeling for diagnosis and prognosis has been growing. In addition to raw/coded health data, wavelet transform and term frequency-inverse document frequency methods were employed to extract predictors. Selecting predictors with potential to highlight special cases and defining new patient similarity metrics were among the gaps identified in the existing literature that provide starting points for future work. Patient status prediction models based on patient similarity and health data offer exciting potential for personalizing and ultimately improving health care, leading to better patient outcomes. © 2017 JMIR Publications Inc.

  abstract={Background: A scoping review to characterize the literature on the use of conversations in social media as a potential source of data for detecting adverse events (AEs) related to health products. Methods: Our specific research questions were (1) What social media listening platforms exist to detect adverse events related to health products, and what are their capabilities and characteristics? (2) What is the validity and reliability of data from social media for detecting these adverse events? MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and relevant websites were searched from inception to May 2016. Any type of document (e.g., manuscripts, reports) that described the use of social media data for detecting health product AEs was included. Two reviewers independently screened citations and full-texts, and one reviewer and one verifier performed data abstraction. Descriptive synthesis was conducted. Results: After screening 3631 citations and 321 full-texts, 70 unique documents with 7 companion reports available from 2001 to 2016 were included. Forty-six documents (66%) described an automated or semi-automated information extraction system to detect health product AEs from social media conversations (in the developmental phase). Seven pre-existing information extraction systems to mine social media data were identified in eight documents. Nineteen documents compared AEs reported in social media data with validated data and found consistent AE discovery in all except two documents. None of the documents reported the validity and reliability of the overall system, but some reported on the performance of individual steps in processing the data. The validity and reliability results were found for the following steps in the data processing pipeline: data de-identification (n = 1), concept identification (n = 3), concept normalization (n = 2), and relation extraction (n = 8). The methods varied widely, and some approaches yielded better results than others. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the use of social media conversations for pharmacovigilance is in its infancy. Although social media data has the potential to supplement data from regulatory agency databases; is able to capture less frequently reported AEs; and can identify AEs earlier than official alerts or regulatory changes, the utility and validity of the data source remains under-studied.

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: To discuss how current research in the area of smart homes and ambient assisted living will be influenced by the use of big data.; METHODS: A scoping review of literature published in scientific journals and conference proceedings was performed, focusing on smart homes, ambient assisted living and big data over the years 2011-2014.; RESULTS: The health and social care market has lagged behind other markets when it comes to the introduction of innovative IT solutions and the market faces a number of challenges as the use of big data will increase. First, there is a need for a sustainable and trustful information chain where the needed information can be transferred from all producers to all consumers in a structured way. Second, there is a need for big data strategies and policies to manage the new situation where information is handled and transferred independently of the place of the expertise. Finally, there is a possibility to develop new and innovative business models for a market that supports cloud computing, social media, crowdsourcing etc.; CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary area of big data, smart homes and ambient assisted living is no longer only of interest for IT developers, it is also of interest for decision makers as customers make more informed choices among today's services. In the future it will be of importance to make information usable for managers and improve decision making, tailor smart home services based on big data, develop new business models, increase competition and identify policies to ensure privacy, security and liability.},
